datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0008.wav|has never been surpassed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0012.wav|especially as no more time is occupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0014.wav|And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0033.wav|but which must certainly have come from the study of the twelfth or even the eleventh century MSS.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0043.wav|A further development of the Roman letter took place at Venice.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0047.wav|Of Jenson it must be said that he carried the development of Roman type as far as it can go:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0048.wav|his letter is admirably clear and regular, but at least as beautiful as any other Roman type.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0049.wav|After his death in the "fourteen eighties," or at least by fourteen ninety, printing in Venice had declined very much;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0050.wav|and though the famous family of Aldus restored its technical excellence, rejecting battered letters,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0051.wav|and paying great attention to the "press work" or actual process of printing,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0054.wav|Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0055.wav|some of which -- as, e.g., that of Jacobus Rubeus or Jacques le Rouge -- is scarcely distinguishable from his.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0059.wav|the greater part of these Italian printers, it should be mentioned, were Germans or Frenchmen, working under the influence of Italian opinion and aims.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0060.wav|It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0061.wav|the Roman letter was used side by side with the Gothic.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0062.wav|Even in Italy most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic letter,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0063.wav|which was generally more formally Gothic than the printing of the German workmen,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0066.wav|In fact Gunther Zeiner's first type (afterwards used by Schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0071.wav|Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0073.wav|went on apace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0075.wav|the worst, which perhaps was the English, was a terrible falling-off from the work of the earlier presses;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0078.wav|to improve the letter in form.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0082.wav|In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one last degradation to undergo.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0084.wav|But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0085.wav|It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0086.wav|are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning of the lines:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0087.wav|for the seventeenth-century letters are at least pure and simple in line. The Italian, Bodoni, and the Frenchman, Didot,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0088.wav|were the leaders in this luckless change, though our own Baskerville, who was at work some years before them, went much on the same lines;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0089.wav|but his letters, though uninteresting and poor, are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the Italian or the Frenchman.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0098.wav|and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0099.wav|It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0110.wav|Even the Caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect:

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0113.wav|there is a grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the c, the a, and so on,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0114.wav|an ugly pear-shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0115.wav|in short, it happens to this craft, as to others, that the utilitarian practice, though it professes to avoid ornament,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0116.wav|still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood conventionality, deduced from what was once ornament, and is by no means useful;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0119.wav|and the elegance and legibility of the ancient more striking than in the Arabic numerals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0121.wav|in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0123.wav|this is awkward if you have to read Bradshaw's Guide in a hurry.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0124.wav|One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0126.wav|Most of Jenson's letters are designed within a square,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0127.wav|the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout; but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0131.wav|the size known as "Long primer" ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0132.wav|Here, again, if the practice of "leading" were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0134.wav|In good printing the spaces between the words should be as near as possible equal
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0136.wav|modern printers understand this, but it is only practiced in the very best establishments.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0137.wav|But another point which they should attend to they almost always disregard;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0139.wav|a blemish which can be nearly, though not wholly, avoided by care and forethought
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0140.wav|the desirable thing being "the breaking of the line" as in bonding masonry or brickwork
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0142.wav|modern printers generally overdo the "whites" in the spacing, a defect probably forced on them by the characterless quality of the letters.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0143.wav|For where these are boldly and carefully designed, and each letter is thoroughly individual in form,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0151.wav|the unit of the book being looked on as the two pages forming an opening.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0152.wav|The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0153.wav|only nominally so, however, in many cases, since when he uses a headline he counts that in,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0154.wav|the result as measured by the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top one, and that the whole opening has an upside-down look vertically
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0155.wav|and that laterally the page looks as if it were being driven off the paper.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0156.wav|The paper on which the printing is to be done is a necessary part of our subject:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0158.wav|it is never used except for very expensive books, although it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very cheapest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0160.wav|by that made in America, which is the worst conceivable.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0165.wav|One fruitful source of badness in paper
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0166.wav|is the habit that publishers have of eking out a thin volume by printing it on thick paper almost of the substance of cardboard,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0168.wav|On the whole, a small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be without being transparent.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0055.wav|This arrangement was, however, modified after eighteen eleven, and the chapel yard was allotted to misdemeanants and prisoners awaiting trial.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0181.wav|There was a master's side for females who could pay the usual fees, but they associated with the rest in the one narrow yard common to all.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0185.wav|There was no separation even for the women under sentence of death, who lived in a common and perpetually crowded ward.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0212.wav|But they nevertheless frequently managed to secrete the means of making away with themselves, and accomplished their purpose.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0213.wav|Convicted murderers were kept continuously in the cells on bread and water,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0214.wav|in couples, from the time of sentence to that of execution, which was about three or four days generally,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0215.wav|from Friday to Monday, so as to include one Sunday, on which day there was a special service for the condemned in the prison chapel.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0234.wav|The bedding was scanty; fuel and light had to be purchased out of prisoners' private means; clothing was issued but rarely,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0237.wav|The fees on reception and discharge must be deemed exorbitant, when it is remembered the impoverished class who usually crowded the jail;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0300.wav|that all prisoners should always be in separate cells by night, and those of short sentences by day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0301.wav|It recommended day cells or rooms for regular labor, which should be compulsory upon all transports and prisoners sentenced to hard labor,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0304.wav|with the penalty of forfeiting the day's allowance of food, an increase of which the committee had recommended.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0305.wav|The provision of more baths was also suggested, and the daily sweeping out of the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0306.wav|The clothes of prisoners arriving dirty, or in rags, should be fumigated before worn in the jail,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0307.wav|but as yet no suggestion was made to provide prison uniform.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0311.wav|The committee took upon itself to lay down stringent rules for the discipline of the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0317.wav|No prisoner should be allowed to obtain superior accommodation on the payment of any fees. Fees indeed should be generally abolished, garnish also.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0318.wav|No prisoners should in future be ironed, except in cases of misconduct,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0329.wav|In common justice to them, it must be admitted that immediate effect was given to all that could be easily carried out.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0332.wav|A certain number of bedsteads were provided, and there was a slight increase in the ration of bread.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0333.wav|But here the recommendations touched at once upon the delicate subject of expense, and it is clear that the committee hesitated on this score.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0334.wav|It made this too the excuse for begging the most important issue of the whole question.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0336.wav|but it at once deprecated the idea that the city could follow the laudable example thus set in the provinces. Quote,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0344.wav|all chances of classification and separation vanished, and the greatest evils remained untouched.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0345.wav|All the committee could do in this respect was to throw the responsibility on others.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0347.wav|It was very desirable that there should be a more speedy removal of transports from Newgate to the ships.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0011.wav|Mr. Neild was compelled to admit in eighteen twelve that "the great reformation produced by Howard
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0012.wav|was in several places merely temporary:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0013.wav|some prisons that had been ameliorated under the persuasive influence of his kind advice were relapsing into their former horrid state of privation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0014.wav|filthiness, severity, or neglect; many new dungeons had aggravated the evils against which his sagacity could not but remonstrate;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0015.wav|the motives for a transient amendment were becoming paralyzed, and the effect had ceased with the cause."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0016.wav|I have shown in a previous chapter what Newgate was at this period, despite a vast expenditure and boasted efforts to introduce reforms.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0017.wav|Some of the county jails, and one or two borough jails, had been rebuilt,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0022.wav|The executive, although harassed by internal commotion and foreign war, was not entirely callous to the crying need for amelioration in jails.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0024.wav|Thus in eighteen thirteen the exaction of jail fees had been forbidden by law,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0025.wav|and two other acts more peremptory and precise followed on the same subject in succeeding years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0026.wav|In eighteen fourteen a bill was brought in to insist upon the appointment of chaplains in jails, and when this had passed into law,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0029.wav|The erection of new prison buildings was made imperative under certain conditions and following certain rules

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0036.wav|it was hoped that their rulers would hire accommodation in the county prisons, and that the inferior establishments would in course of time disappear.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0062.wav|and the reason is plain: you have taken him from his home, and have deprived him of the means of providing himself with the necessaries or comforts of life,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0063.wav|and therefore you are bound to furnish him with moderate indeed but suitable accommodation."

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0102.wav|were to be kept in every jail, and the prisoners directed to wash in them before release. These provisions were almost a dead letter.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0190.wav|There were eighty-four separate sleeping-cells, and unless the jail was overcrowded, every inmate passed the night alone,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0193.wav|Prisoners on reception were treated as they are now-a-days -- bathed, dressed in prison clothes, and inspected by the surgeon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0195.wav|Personal cleanliness was insisted upon, and all parts of the prison were kept scrupulously clean.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0197.wav|No idleness was permitted among the inmates. Trades were taught, or prisoners were allowed to follow their own if suitable.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0199.wav|This made exertion compulsory, and imposed hard labor as a proper punishment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0200.wav|Another jail, that of Ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. It exhibited all the good points of that at Bury.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0202.wav|A system not adopted generally till nearly half a century later had already prevailed at Ilchester.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0205.wav|Industrial labor had also been introduced with satisfactory results.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0206.wav|Blanket weaving and cloth spinning was carried on prosperously,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0207.wav|and all the material for prisoners' apparel was manufactured in the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0210.wav|There was a prison laundry too, where all the prisoners' linen was regularly washed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0211.wav|The moral welfare of the inmates was as closely looked after as the physical.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0212.wav|There was an attentive chaplain, a schoolmaster, and regular religious and other instruction.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0213.wav|Compared with those highly meritorious institutions Newgate still showed but badly.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0216.wav|The most noticeable of the improvements introduced was a better regulation of dietaries within the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0217.wav|The old haphazard system, by which meat was issued in bulk,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0222.wav|Meat was no longer issued raw, to be imperfectly cooked before a ward fire and bolted gluttonously, the whole two pounds at one sitting.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0223.wav|Mr. Brown confidently asserted that no jail in England now fed its inmates so well as did Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0224.wav|So plentiful was this dietary, that although the old permission remained in force of allowing the friends of prisoners to bring them supplies from outside,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0225.wav|the practice was falling into abeyance, and the prisoners seldom required private assistance to eke out their meals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0227.wav|Mr. Brown also, much to his own credit, brought about the abandonment of the practice of ironing all prisoners as a matter of course.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0229.wav|Convicts were not even compelled to wear irons, providing they behaved well.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0230.wav|It was found that shackles might be safely dispensed with, even in the case of the most desperate characters.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0231.wav|This was effected by stopping the nearly indiscriminate admission of visitors, which had hitherto prevailed all over the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0232.wav|Ironing it will be remembered, was a distinguishing badge, so that when the jail was cleared the free might be readily known from the captive, and escapes prevented.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0233.wav|Under the new rule visitors were not allowed to pass into the interior of the prison, but were detained between the grating.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0234.wav|This change led to some discontent, until it was found that the much greater boon of relief from irons accompanied it, and the reform was quietly accepted.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0018.wav|an imputation which the Society indignantly and very justly repudiated, the statement being, as they said,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0019.wav|refuted by abundant evidence, and having no foundation whatever in truth.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0020.wav|Among those whom the Society found arrayed against it was Sydney Smith,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0022.wav|While fully admitting the good intentions of the Society, he condemned their ultra humanitarianism as misplaced.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0023.wav|He took exception to various of the proposals of the Society. He thought they leant too much to a system of indulgence and education in jails.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0025.wav|"A poor man who is lucky enough," he said, "to have his son committed for a felony

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0060.wav|The Society did not limit its remarks to the description of what had already been done
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0061.wav|but it offered suggestions for future buildings, with numerous carefully-executed drawings and designs of the model it recommended for imitation.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0091.wav|Last, but not least, the use of irons was strictly forbidden, "except in cases of urgent and absolute necessity,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0093.wav|The second act, passed in the following year, enlarged and amended the first, and at the same time gave powers to the House

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0098.wav|The Society did not shrink from its self-imposed duty, but continued year after year, with unflagging energy and unflinching spirit, to watch closely
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0099.wav|and report at length upon the condition of the prisons of the country.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0100.wav|For this purpose it kept up an extensive correspondence with all parts of the kingdom, and circulated queries to be answered in detail,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0102.wav|Upon these and the private visitations made by various members the Society obtained the facts,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0119.wav|No attempt was made to maintain discipline.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0121.wav|By degrees, however,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0122.wav|the changes necessary to bring the prisons into conformity with the recent acts were attempted, if not actually introduced into the county prisons, to which,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0123.wav|with a few of the more important city or borough prisons, these acts more especially applied.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0125.wav|or to reappropriate, reconstruct, and patch up the existing prisons till they were more in accordance with the growing requirements of the times.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0127.wav|Workshops were built at many prisons, various kinds of manufactures and trades were set on foot, including weaving, matting, shoe-making, and tailoring.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0130.wav|There were tread-wheels at most of the prisons, and regular employment thereon or at some other kind of hard labor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0131.wav|In many places too where the prisoners earned money by their work, they were granted a portion of it for their own use after proper deduction for maintenance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0132.wav|Only a few glaring evils still demanded a remedy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0133.wav|The provision of separate sleeping cells was still quite inadequate. For instance,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0134.wav|in twenty-two county jails there were one thousand sixty-three sleeping cells in all (in eighteen twenty-three)
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0135.wav|and the average daily number committed that year amounted to three thousand, nine hundred eighty-five.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0146.wav|and was indeed destined to continue for another half century, in other words, until the introduction of the Prison Act of eighteen seventy-seven.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0147.wav|At the time of which I am writing there was great diversity of practice as regards the hours of labor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0149.wav|The nature of the employment varied greatly in severity, especially the tread-wheel labor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0151.wav|in others women were very properly exempted from it, and also from all severe labor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0156.wav|in others meat, soup, gruel, beer were given.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0161.wav|too much discretion was still left to the magistracy to fill in the details. The legislature only recommended,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0162.wav|it did not peremptorily insist. Too often the letter of the law was observed, but not its spirit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0163.wav|One great impediment to wide amelioration was that a vast number of small jails lay out of reach of the law.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0164.wav|When the new acts were introduced, numerous prisons under local jurisdiction were exempted from the operation of the law.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0166.wav|Mr. Peel, who as Home Secretary had charge of the bill,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0173.wav|I shall not hesitate to ask Parliament for powers to compel them to make the necessary alterations, for it is not to be endured that these local jurisdictions should remain

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0177.wav|Nearly every one of these jurisdictions had its own prison, and there were one hundred and sixty such jails in all.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0180.wav|It was in these jails, withdrawn from the pressure of authority, that the new rules were invariably ignored.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0183.wav|All that was urged was that the borough magistracy had no right to govern their jails
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0185.wav|As time passed, however, these magistrates made no effort at reform.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0187.wav|As the Society put it in eighteen twenty-seven, "the friends to the improvement of prison discipline will regret to learn

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0198.wav|In another borough, with a population of ten thousand, the prison was of the same dimensions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0199.wav|One cell was a dungeon, and the other an "improper and unhealthy abode for any human being," with a watercourse running through it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0206.wav|At Godmanchester there was no jail, but a cage to secure prisoners till they could be taken before a magistrate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0212.wav|and the prison allowance was still limited to bread and water.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0213.wav|Newgate through all these years continued a bye-word with the Society.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0214.wav|Some reforms had certainly been introduced, such as the abolition of irons, already referred to, and the establishment of male and female infirmaries.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0218.wav|The chapel still continued incommodious and insufficient
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0221.wav|and the panes were filled in with oiled paper, an insufficient protection against the weather;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0227.wav|It was enacted that the court of aldermen should make rules for the government of the prison, and that these should be posted publicly within the walls.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0229.wav|By another clause of the Jail Act, two justices were to be appointed to visit the prison at least thrice in every quarter, and "oftener if occasion required."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0230.wav|These justices were to inspect every part of the prison, and examine into the state and condition of prisoners.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0008.wav|These gentlemen were appointed in October eighteen thirty-five, owing to the strong representations of the Lords' Committee
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0011.wav|that inspectors should watch over the observance of the law. He saw no objection on the score of their probable interference with the local jurisdiction,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0013.wav|Sir Frederick Roe was of the same opinion as regards the appointment, but he would give the inspectors the power of acting as well as reporting.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0014.wav|They should be persons, he thought, selected from the highest class; the duty was most important,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0016.wav|These considerations no doubt had weight

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0026.wav|England was represented by Mr. Crawford, and the result of his inquiry was given to the public as an appendix to the House of Commons' Report on Secondary Punishments.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0040.wav|The fact was that the years as they passed, nearly twenty in all, had worked but little permanent improvement in this detestable prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0042.wav|Relapse was rapid and inevitable, so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0043.wav|The disgraceful overcrowding had been partially ended, but the same evils of indiscriminate association were still present; there was the old neglect of decency,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0044.wav|the same callous indifference to the moral well-being of the prisoners, the same want of employment and of all disciplinary control.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0045.wav|All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0047.wav|The prison had become more or less a place of detention only, harboring mainly those awaiting trial.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0048.wav|To these were still added an average of about fifty expecting the last penalty of the law; a certain number of transports awaiting removal to the colonies;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0050.wav|the Exchequer, the Commissioners of bankruptcy and of taxes; smugglers, and a larger number sentenced for very short terms,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0051.wav|and for offenses of the most varying description, by the Central Criminal Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0053.wav|and the whole by proper management might have been so accommodated as to prevent overcrowding.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0058.wav|but the occupants of each were huddled together indiscriminately. The inspectors found in the same wards in the chapel yard the convicted and the untried,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0059.wav|the felon and the misdemeanant, the sane and the insane, the old and young offender.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0062.wav|In another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offenses shut up with lads of tender years;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0064.wav|In the master's side yard, which had only one washing place, as many as seventy-eight prisoners, frequently more,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0065.wav|were associated together, "of every variety of age, habit, and delinquency, without employment, oversight, or control."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0066.wav|In the middle yard it was still worse.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0076.wav|He blamed the construction of Newgate for the neglect of classification, and was yet compelled to confess that he had made no attempt whatever to carry it out.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0077.wav|The fact was, he did not keep the classification of prisoners on first arrival in his own hands, nor even in that of his officers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0078.wav|A new prisoner's fate, as to location, rested really with a powerful fellow-prisoner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0079.wav|The inspectors found that prisoners had their places assigned to them

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0094.wav|Sometimes two mats were allotted to three sleepers. Sometimes four slept under the same bedding, and left their mats unoccupied.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0095.wav|The rugs used were never washed; an order existed that the bedding should be taken into the yards to be aired, but it was not very punctually obeyed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0096.wav|The only convenience for personal ablutions were the pumps in the yards, and the far-off baths in the condemned or press-yard.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0104.wav|but its issue was precarious, and dependent on the good will of the wardsmen, who measured out the portions to each according to his eye,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0105.wav|and not with weights and measures, no turnkey being present.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0106.wav|Too much was left to the wardsman. It was he who could issue small luxuries;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0107.wav|he sold tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, although prohibited, and extra beer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0113.wav|The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted, and so entirely unchecked, degenerated into a baneful despotism.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0114.wav|They bought their offices from one another, and were thus considered to have a vested interest in them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0115.wav|Their original capital had been a few shillings, and for this they purchased the right to tax their fellows to the extent of pounds per week.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0116.wav|The wardsman had a monopoly in supplying provisions, gave dinner and breakfast at his own price, and was such complete master of the ward
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0118.wav|He made collections when it suited him for ward purposes, to be spent as he chose, in candles and so forth.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0120.wav|by drawing briefs and petitions for his fellows. There was a recognized charge of five shillings per brief,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0129.wav|He was on the most intimate and improperly familiar terms with the turnkeys,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0130.wav|had a key of both the master's side and middle side yards, was the only person present at the distribution of beer, and was trusted to examine,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0132.wav|All the wardsmen alike were more or less irresponsible.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0135.wav|the victim of this cruel ill-usage having "more fear of the power of the wardsman to injure him, than confidence in the governor's power to protect him."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0136.wav|These wardsmen, besides thus ruling the roast, had numerous special privileges, if such they can be called.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0139.wav|Nobody interfered with them or regulated their conduct. They might get drunk when so disposed, and did so frequently, alone or in company.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0145.wav|He could indulge in snuff if a snuff-taker,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0146.wav|and might always smoke his pipe undisturbed; for although the use of tobacco had been prohibited since the report of the Lords Committee,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0150.wav|and then only went round to count the number.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0151.wav|Many of them were otherwise and improperly occupied for hours every day in menial services for the governor, cleaning his windows or grooming his horse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0152.wav|One turnkey had been so employed several hours daily for nearly eleven years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0153.wav|It was not strange that subordinates should neglect their duty when superiors set the example.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0154.wav|Nothing was more prominently brought out by the inspectors than the inefficiency of the governor at that time, Mr. Cope.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0155.wav|He may have erred in some points through ignorance, but in others he was clearly guilty of culpable neglect.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0156.wav|We have seen that he took no pains to classify and separate prisoners on reception.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0157.wav|This was only one of many grave omissions on his part. He did not feel it incumbent on himself to visit his prison often or see his prisoners.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0159.wav|The prisoners declared that they did not see him oftener than twice a week;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0160.wav|one man who had been in the condemned ward for two months, said the governor only came there four times.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0164.wav|But when he did visit, his inspections were of the most superficial character
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0166.wav|dice, dangerous implements, or other prohibited articles.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0169.wav|He really did not know what passed in his jail
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0172.wav|and evils that should have been speedily rooted out remained because they had the prescription of long usage.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0177.wav|and it was not the least part of the blame imputed to him that he made special favorites of particular prisoners, retaining of his own accord in Newgate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0181.wav|It was the same old story -- evil constantly in the ascendant, the least criminal at the mercy of the most depraved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0183.wav|the apathy of the authorities, and the undue ascendancy of those who, as convicted felons, should have been most sternly repressed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0186.wav|said with justice that "incredible scenes of horror occur in Newgate."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0188.wav|The days were passed in idleness, debauchery, riotous quarreling, immoral conversation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0191.wav|No provision whatever was made for the employment of prisoners, no materials were purchased, no trade instructors appointed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0194.wav|Gaming of all kinds, although forbidden by the Jail Acts, was habitually practiced.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0195.wav|This was admitted in evidence by the turnkeys, and was proved by the appearance of the prison tables, which bore the marks of gaming-boards deeply cut into them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0196.wav|Prisoners confessed that it was a favorite occupation, the chief games being "shoving halfpence" on the table,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0199.wav|the most popular being the "Times," "Morning Herald," and "Morning Chronicle"; on Sunday the "Weekly Dispatch," "Bell's Life," and the "Weekly Messenger."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0200.wav|The newsman had free access to the prison; he passed in unsearched and unexamined, and, unaccompanied by an officer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0201.wav|went at once to his customers, who bought their paper and paid for it themselves.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0202.wav|The news-vendor was also a tobacconist,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0203.wav|and he had thus ample means of introducing to the prisoners the prohibited but always much-coveted and generally procurable weed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0206.wav|and publications which in these days would have been made the subject of a criminal prosecution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0207.wav|One of these, published by Stockdale, the inspectors styled "a book of the most disgusting nature."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0208.wav|There was also a good supply of Bibles and prayers,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0214.wav|but no steps were taken to prevent any prisoner from obtaining more if he could pay for it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0216.wav|Not only did prisoners come again and again for a "pint," but large quantities were carried off to the wards to be drunk later in the day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0217.wav|There were more varied, and at times, especially when beer had circulated freely, more uproarious diversions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0219.wav|leap-frog, puss in the corner, and "fly the garter," for which purpose the rugs were spread out to prevent feet slipping on the floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0223.wav|There was much swearing and bad language, the very worst that could be used, from the first thing in the morning to the last thing at night.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0225.wav|If any man presumed to turn in too early
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0227.wav|or his bedclothes were drawn away across the room.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0229.wav|which they dropped smoldering into their fellow-prisoners' pockets.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0230.wav|Often the victim, goaded to madness, attacked his tormentors; a fight was then certain to follow.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0231.wav|These fights sometimes took place in the daytime, when a ring was regularly formed, and two or three stood by the door to watch for the officer's approach.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0232.wav|More often they occurred at night, and were continued to the bitter end.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0233.wav|The prisoners in this way administered serious punishment on one another. Black eyes and broken noses were always to be seen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0234.wav|More cruel injuries were common enough, which did not result from honest hand-to-hand fights.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0237.wav|"A lad named Matthew White has had a wound in his eye by a bone thrown at him, which very nearly destroyed vision."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0241.wav|A prisoner Baxter is in the infirmary in consequence of a severe injury to his wrist-joint.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0242.wav|Watkins' case, referred to above, is made the subject of another and a special report from the surgeon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0244.wav|Violent inflammation and extensive suppuration ensued, and for a considerable time amputation seemed inevitable.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0245.wav|After severe suffering prolonged for many months, the inflammation was subdued, but the cartilage of the knee-joint was destroyed, and he was crippled for life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0246.wav|On another occasion a young man, who was being violently teased, seized a knife and stabbed his tormentor in the back.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0247.wav|The prisoner who used the knife was secured, but it was the wardsman, and not the officers, to whom the report was made, and no official inquiry or punishment followed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0248.wav|Matters were at times still worse, and the rioting went on to such dangerous lengths as to endanger the safety of the building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0251.wav|but the presence and authority of the governor himself became indispensable.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0254.wav|Other regulations laid down by the Jail Acts were still defied. One of these was that prisoners should be restricted to the jail allowance of food;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0257.wav|hot meat, poultry, and fish were also forbidden.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0258.wav|But the inspectors found in the ward cupboards mince-pies and other pasties, cold joints, hams, and so forth.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0259.wav|Many other articles were introduced by visitors, including money, tobacco, pipes, and snuff.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0261.wav|together with four bradawls, several large iron spikes, screws, nails, and knives;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0262.wav|all of them instruments calculated to facilitate attempts at breaking out of prison,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0263.wav|and capable of becoming most dangerous weapons in the hands of desperate and determined men.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0268.wav|Women saw men if they merely pretended to be wives; even boys were visited by their sweethearts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0270.wav|But no search was made to intercept prohibited articles at the gate, and there was no permanent gate-keeper,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0271.wav|which would have greatly helped to keep out bad characters. Some idea of the difficulty and inconvenience of these lax regulations as regards visiting,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0272.wav|may be gathered from the statement that as many as three hundred were often admitted on the same day
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0274.wav|Perhaps the worst feature of the visiting system was the permission accorded to male prisoners "under the name of husbands, brothers, and sons"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0277.wav|But there were evils akin to those on the male side, prominent amongst which was the undue influence accorded to prisoners.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0280.wav|The clothing was still meager and ragged: the washing places insufficient, and wanting in decency;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0282.wav|the pump was the only provision, and this in a place within sight of visitors, of the windows of the male turnkeys, and unprotected from the weather.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0285.wav|which numbers of well-meaning but inquisitive people were anxious to witness.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0288.wav|The separation of the sexes was not indeed rigidly carried out in Newgate as yet.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0289.wav|We have seen that male prisoners visited their female relations and friends on the female side. Besides this,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0290.wav|the gatesman who prepared the briefs had interviews with female prisoners alone while taking their instructions; a female came alone and unaccompanied by a matron
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0292.wav|male prisoners carried coal into the female prison, when they saw and could speak or pass letters to the female prisoners;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0294.wav|In the bail-dock, where most improper general association was permitted, the female prisoners were often altogether in the charge of male turnkeys.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0295.wav|The governor was also personally responsible for gross contravention of this rule of separation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0296.wav|and was in the habit of drawing frequently upon the female prison for prisoners to act as domestic servants in his own private dwelling.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0298.wav|while older women in infirm health were sent across the seas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0300.wav|but he afterwards admitted that the girl had been recommended to him by the principal turnkey, who knew something of her friends.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0303.wav|This girl had been first engaged on account of the extra work entailed by certain prisoners
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0305.wav|The house at this time was full of men and visitors; waiters came in from the taverns with meals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0307.wav|There was reveling and roistering, as usual, with "high life below-stairs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0308.wav|The governor sent down wine on festive occasions, of which no doubt the prisoner housemaid had her share.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0008.wav|their especial care.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0010.wav|by their presence and their pious, disinterested efforts, to restrain the dissolute manners and vicious language of the unhappy and depraved inmates.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0011.wav|But it was already plain that they constituted an independent authority within the jails; they were frequently in conflict with the chaplain,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0012.wav|who not strangely resented the orders issued by the aldermen
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0013.wav|that women should be frequently kept from chapel in order that they might attend the ladies' lectures and exhortations.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0014.wav|The admission of a crowd of visitors to assist in these lay services has already been remarked upon; as the inspectors pointed out,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0017.wav|It is to be feared too that although the surface was thus whitewashed and decorous, much that was vicious still festered and rankled beneath,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0018.wav|and that when the restraining influences of the ladies were absent, the female prisoners relapsed into immoral and uncleanly discourse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0021.wav|"she had never witnessed such scenes before, and hopes she never shall again -- it was dreadful!"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0022.wav|After locking-up time, which varied, as on the male side, according to the daylight, the scenes were often riotous and disgraceful.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0023.wav|The poor, who could afford no luxuries, went to bed early, but were kept awake by the revelries of the rich,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0032.wav|were jumbled up together, higgledy-piggledy, the old and the young, the murderer and the child who had broken into a dwelling.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0041.wav|The whole of these seventeen had, however, a common airing-yard, and took their exercise there at the same time,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0043.wav|were associated continually with a number of those who could look with certainty on a mitigation of punishment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0046.wav|laughing and uproarious, utterly unmindful of the companionship of men upon whom lay the shadow of an impending shameful death.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0061.wav|He left off because he was so much interfered with and laughed at, and from seeing that no success attended his efforts, owing to the evils arising from association.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0062.wav|Latterly his ministrations to the condemned had been restricted to a visit on Sunday afternoons, and occasionally about once a fortnight on a week-day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0063.wav|It is only fair to Mr. Cotton to add that, according to his own journal, he was unremitting in his attentions to convicts who were actually cast for death,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0180.wav|The publication of this report raised a storm in the city, and the corporation was roused to make an immediate protest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0181.wav|A committee of aldermen was forthwith appointed to report upon the inspectors' report,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0182.wav|and the result was another lengthy blue book, printed in the parliamentary papers, eighteen thirty-six,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0183.wav|traversing where it was possible the statements of the inspectors, and offering explanation and palliation of such evils as could not be denied.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0187.wav|the neglect of the condemned convicts, the filthy condition of the wards, the insufficiency of bedding and clothing,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0188.wav|the misemployment of officers and prisoners by the governor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0193.wav|The measures of improvement introduced were mainly as follows:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0194.wav|the fixing of "inspection holes" in the doors and walls, so as to insure more supervision; of windows opening into the well-holes,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0196.wav|the provision of dining-rooms and dining-tables.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0198.wav|The windows were to be glazed and painted to prevent prisoners from looking out;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0199.wav|baths, fumigating places for clothing, wash-house, and the removal of dust-bins, completed the new arrangements in the main prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0200.wav|In the press-yard, the press-room and ward above it were parceled out into nine separate sleeping cells;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0201.wav|each was provided with an iron bedstead, and a small desk at which the condemned man might read or write.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0203.wav|"The mischief of jail associations," say the inspectors,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0204.wav|"which has been demonstrably proved to be the fruitful source of all the abuses and irregularities which have so long disgraced Newgate,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0206.wav|In endeavoring to arrest contamination, prisoners were more closely confined, and associated in smaller numbers;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0207.wav|but this had the effect of throwing them into closer contact, and of making them more intimately acquainted with, more directly influential upon, one another.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0208.wav|In the inspectors' fourth report, dated eighteen thirty-nine,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0210.wav|Abuses and irregularities, which had been partially remedied by the reform introduced in eighteen thirty-seven, were once more in the ascendant.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0211.wav|"In our late visits," they say, "we have seen manifest indications of a retrograde movement in this respect,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0212.wav|and a tendency to return to much of that laxity and remissness which formerly marked the management of this prison."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0217.wav|They go on to say
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0218.wav|Newgate is only less extensively injurious than formerly because it is less crowded.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0219.wav|The effects of the imprisonment are to vitiate its inmates, to extend their acquaintanceship with each other,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0220.wav|to corrupt the prisoner charged with an offense of which he may be innocent, and to confirm in guilt the young and inexperienced offender.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0221.wav|The reports as the years flow on reiterate the same complaints.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0222.wav|Much bitterness of feeling is evidently engendered, and the corporation grows more and more angry with the inspectors.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0231.wav|in which the master evil of jail association and consequent contamination still continues to operate directly to the encouragement of crime.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0232.wav|The plan adopted for ventilating the dining-room on the 'master's side' and that of the middle yard is very inefficient;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0233.wav|it consists of several circular perforations, about two inches in diameter,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0234.wav|slanting downwards from the top of the walls to the outside adjoining the slaughterhouses of Newgate market; and occasionally, in hot weather,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0236.wav|Sometimes the stench in hot weather is said to be very bad.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0032.wav|a scaffold was erected in front of that prison for the execution of several convicts named by the Recorder.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0044.wav|and at the distance of five feet from the same is fixed a strong railing all round the scaffold to enclose a place for the constables.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0045.wav|In the middle of this machinery is placed a movable platform, in form of a trap-door, ten feet long by eight wide,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0048.wav|it is supported by two beams, which are held in their place by bolts. The movement of the lever withdraws the bolts, the platform falls in;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0049.wav|and this, being much more sudden and regular than that of a cart being drawn away, has the effect of immediate death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0050.wav|A broadsheet dated April twenty-fourth, seventeen eighty-seven, describing an execution on the newly-invented scaffold before the debtors' door,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0051.wav|says, "The scaffold on which these miserable people suffered is a temporary machine which was drawn out of the yard of the sessions house by horses;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0053.wav|the whole is temporary, being all calculated to take to pieces, which are preserved within the prison."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0056.wav|The Dublin "engine of death," as the gallows are styled in the account from which the following description is taken, consisted of an iron bar
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0057.wav|parallel to the prison wall, and about four feet from it, but strongly affixed thereto with iron scroll clamps.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0058.wav|From this bar hang several iron loops, in which the halters are tied.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0059.wav|Under this bar at a proper distance is a piece of flooring or platform,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0063.wav|while the criminals stand upon it, by two pieces of timber, which are made to slide in and out of the prison wall through apertures made for that purpose.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0065.wav|They are both drawn at once by a windlass, and the unhappy culprits remain suspended.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0066.wav|This mode of execution, it is alleged, gave rise to the old vulgar "chaff," "Take care, or you'll die at the fall of the leaf."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0067.wav|The machinery in use in Dublin is much the same as that employed at many jails now-a-days.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0068.wav|But the fall apart and inwards of two leaves is considered superior.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0069.wav|The latter is the method still followed at Newgate.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0079.wav|She walked from the debtors' door to a stake fixed in the ground about half-way between the scaffold and Newgate Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0081.wav|and after praying fervently for a few minutes, the steps on which she stood were drawn away, and she was left suspended.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0177.wav|The catastrophe exceeded the worst anticipations. Nearly one hundred dead and dying lay about; and after all had been removed,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0192.wav|As early as six a.m. the number assembled already exceeded that seen on ordinary occasions;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0195.wav|Every window had its party of occupants; the adjoining roofs were equally crowded.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0196.wav|High prices were asked and paid for front seats or good standing room. As much as five pounds was given for the attic story

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0211.wav|Gin-shops and coffee-houses were the first to open doors, and touts began to bid for tenants for the various rooms upstairs.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0217.wav|a throng of people whom neither rain, snow, storm, nor darkness ever hindered from attending the show.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0227.wav|slipshod and slovenly, in crushed bonnet and dirty shawl, the gown fastened by a single hook,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0229.wav|Above the murmur and tumult of that noisy assembly, the lowing and bleating of cattle as they were driven into the stalls and pens of Smithfield
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0230.wav|fell with a strange unnatural sound upon the ear
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0236.wav|coiled up on the floor of the scaffold like a serpent, the hangman's rope!
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0239.wav|The loud shout of the multitude once more subsided, or only fell upon the abstracted ear like the dreamy murmur of an ocean shell.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0243.wav|Threading his way among these itinerant vendors was seen the meek-faced deliverer of tracts, the man of good intentions, now bonneted,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0247.wav|but ever the same form moved along in the fulfillment of his mission, in spite of all persecution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0249.wav|Blinded with their long hair, they tore at each other like two furies; their bonnets and caps were trodden underfoot in the kennel,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0252.wav|Another deep roar, louder than any which had preceded it, broke from the multitude.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0253.wav|Then came the cry of 'Hats off!' and 'Down in front!' as at a theatre.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0255.wav|the iron knell that rang upon the beating heart of the living man who was about to die;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0257.wav|In thus describing the saturnalia before the gallows I have been drawn on somewhat beyond the period with which I am at present dealing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0258.wav|Let me retrace my steps, and speak more in detail of the treatment of the condemned in those bloodthirsty and brutally indifferent days,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0261.wav|In the case of convicted murderers only was prompt punishment inflicted,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0264.wav|But the murderers formed only a small proportion of the total number sentenced to death, and for the rest there was a long period of anxious suspense,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0265.wav|although in the long run mercy generally prevailed, and very few capitally convicted for crimes less than murder actually suffered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0266.wav|Thus in the years between May first, eighteen twenty-seven, and thirtieth April, eighteen thirty-one,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0267.wav|no less than four hundred and fifty-one sentences of death for capital crimes were passed at the Old Bailey;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0270.wav|and while the courts adhered to the letter of the law, appeals were constantly made to the royal prerogative of mercy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0272.wav|Judges on assize were satisfied with simply recording a sentence of death against offenders whom they did not think deserved the extreme penalty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0273.wav|At the Old Bailey almost every one capitally convicted by a jury was sentenced to be hanged.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0275.wav|but there was a further appeal then, as now, to the king himself, or practically to the Home Secretary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0277.wav|Convicted offenders might have good or bad luck; they might be arraigned when their particular crime was uncommon, and were then nearly certain to escape;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0278.wav|or theirs might be one of many, and it might be considered necessary to "make an example."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0279.wav|In this latter it might fairly be said that a man was put to death less for his own sins than for the crimes of others.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0281.wav|They found at Newgate, under disgraceful conditions as already described,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0282.wav|seventeen capital convicts, upon all of whom the sentence of death had been passed. Eventually two only of the whole number suffered;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0283.wav|two others were sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and the balance to varying terms.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0286.wav|The inspectors very properly desired to call attention to the inevitable tendency in this mode of dealing with "the most awful sanctions of the law,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0288.wav|The consequences were plainly proved to the inspectors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0289.wav|Capitally convicted prisoners did, as a matter of fact, "treat with habitual and inexpressible levity the sentence of death."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0290.wav|Of this I have treated at length in the last chapter.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0293.wav|Sometimes the Privy Council did not meet for months, and during all that time the convicts languished with hope
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0296.wav|The time of the arrival of this report was generally known at Newgate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0298.wav|Sometimes the report was delayed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0299.wav|On one occasion, Mr. Wakefield tells us, the Recorder, who had attended the council at Windsor, did not deliver the report till the following day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0300.wav|The prisoners and their friends, therefore, were kept in a state of the most violent suspense for many hours,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0304.wav|to utter imprecations against the Recorder, the Secretary of State, the Council, and the King;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0306.wav|I myself heard more than one of those whose lives were spared by that decision of the council,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0307.wav|afterwards express a wish to murder the Recorder for having kept them so long in suspense.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0309.wav|Its receipt was immediately followed by the promulgation of its contents to the persons most closely concerned,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0310.wav|which was done with a sort of ceremony intended to be impressive.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0311.wav|The whole of the convicts were assembled together in one ward, and made to kneel down.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0312.wav|To them entered the chaplain or ordinary of Newgate in full canonicals,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0316.wav|"A. B., your case has been taken into consideration by the king in council, and His Majesty has been mercifully pleased to spare your life."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0317.wav|The fatal news was not always received in the same way.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0318.wav|The men who were doomed often fell down in convulsions upon the floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0002.wav|It is satisfactory to be able to record that some consideration was shown the capital convict actually awaiting execution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0004.wav|would be astonished to observe the peculiar tenderness, I was going to add respect,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0007.wav|Once ordered to the cells, friends of all classes suddenly rise up; his fellow-prisoners, the turnkeys, the chaplain,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0008.wav|the keepers, and the sheriffs all seem interested in his fate, and he can make no reasonable request that is not at once granted by whomsoever he may address.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0011.wav|Mr. Wakefield goes on to remark that persons convicted of forgery "excited an extraordinary degree of interest in all who approached them."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0013.wav|and kept altogether separate from the other prisoners until the day of his death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0016.wav|He seems to have improved the occasion when preaching the condemned sermon before Fauntleroy, by pointing a moral from that unhappy man's own case.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0017.wav|For this the chaplain was a few days later summoned before the jail committee of aldermen,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0025.wav|As to the exclusion of strangers on these occasions,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0026.wav|the experience I have had convinces me that one, and perhaps the only, good of an execution, i. e. the solemn admonition to the public,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0027.wav|will thereby be lost.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0028.wav|Probably the reader will side with the aldermen against the ordinary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0030.wav|and the idea will be strengthened by the following account of the Sunday service in the prison chapel on the occasion when the condemned sermon was preached.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0032.wav|Strangers were now excluded, but the sheriffs attended in state, wearing their gold chains,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0033.wav|while behind their pew stood a couple of tall footmen in state liveries.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0040.wav|whose desk and pulpit were just in front of the condemned pew, and within a couple of yards of it.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0049.wav|For this offense the punishment is death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0051.wav|His look at the sheriffs and the ordinary is full of scorn and defiance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0052.wav|The third convict is a sheep-stealer, a poor ignorant fellow in whose crime are mitigating circumstances,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0053.wav|but who is left to die on the supposition that this is not his first conviction, and still more because a good many sheep have of late been stolen by other people.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0056.wav|The last of the four is said to have been a clergyman of the Church of England, condemned for forgery, "a miserable old man in a tattered suit of black.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0067.wav|The service proceeds. At last the burial service is reached.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0069.wav|The ordinary observes him, looks to the sheriffs, and says aloud, 'The service for the dead!'

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0080.wav|The text, without another word, is enough to raise the wildest passions of the audience
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0082.wav|except the clergyman and the burglar, the former of whom is still rolled up at the bottom of the condemned pew,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0083.wav|while the eyes of the latter are wandering round the chapel, and one of them is occasionally winked impudently at some acquaintance amongst the prisoners for trial.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0116.wav|On the following day the capital convicts, whose companions have been hanged, are required to return thanks for their narrow escape.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0117.wav|The firmest disbeliever in religion, if he had not lately been irritated by taking part in such a scene as the condemned service in Newgate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0118.wav|could hardly witness this ceremony without being affected. The men, who were so lately snatched from the jaws of death,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0119.wav|kneel, whilst the rest of the congregation sit, and the ordinary, in a tone of peculiar solemnity, says,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0120.wav|Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0121.wav|for all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us, and to all men;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0122.wav|particularly to those who desire now to offer up their praises and thanksgivings for thy late mercies vouchsafed unto them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0123.wav|Could any one, knowing the late situation of the kneeling men, looking as they do at the empty pew,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0124.wav|occupied when they saw it last, but a few hours ago, by their comrades who are now dead;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0125.wav|could any one, not disgusted with the religious ceremonials of Newgate, witness this scene without emotion?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0127.wav|But what are the feelings of those who take part in it?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0128.wav|I have been present at the scene not less than twenty times, and have invariably observed
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0130.wav|winked at other prisoners in derision of what was taking place; and I have frequently heard men and lads who had been of the kneeling party
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0132.wav|Although this misapplication of religious services still went on,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0133.wav|the outside public continued to be excluded from the Newgate chapel on the day the condemned sermon was preached.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0134.wav|This very proper rule was, however, set aside on the Sunday preceding Courvoisier's execution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0135.wav|So many applications for admission were made to the sheriffs,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0138.wav|all the avenues to the prison gates were blocked by ticket-holders.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0139.wav|In spite of the throng, owing to the excellent arrangements made by the sheriffs,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0140.wav|no inconvenience was suffered by the congregation, among whom were Lord Adolphus Fitz Clarence, Lord Coventry,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0142.wav|Contemporary accounts give a minute description of the demeanor of the convict upon this solemn occasion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0144.wav|In fact his looks denoted extreme sorrow and contrition,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0146.wav|Mr. Carver, the ordinary, appears to have addressed himself directly to Courvoisier,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0147.wav|and to have dwelt with more emphasis than good taste upon the nature of the crime, and the necessity for repentance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0148.wav|But the chaplain admitted that the solitude of the convict's cell
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0150.wav|So far as I can find, Courvoisier was the last condemned criminal who was thus exhibited to a crowd of morbidly curious spectators.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0154.wav|Mr. Charles Kean the tragedian was also present,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0155.wav|drawn to this terrible exhibition by the example of his father, the more celebrated Edmund Kean, who had witnessed the execution of Thistlewood
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0157.wav|But there is little doubt that as executions became more rare they made more impression on the public mind.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0162.wav|Nevertheless, after that date no person whatever was executed for this offense.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0165.wav|House-breaking, as distinguished from burglary, was similarly exempted in the following year;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0166.wav|next, the offenses of returning from transportation, stealing post-office letters, and sacrilege were no longer punishable with death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0167.wav|In eighteen thirty-seven Lord John Russell's acts swept away a number of capital offenses, including cutting and maiming, rick-burning,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0169.wav|Within a couple of years the number of persons sentenced to death in England had fallen from four hundred and thirty-eight in eighteen thirty-seven
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0172.wav|While in London, for instance, in eighteen twenty-nine, twenty-four persons had been executed for crimes other than murder,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0175.wav|and in eighteen forty-one this was accepted as the almost universally established rule.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0177.wav|With the amelioration of the criminal code, other cruel concomitants of execution also disappeared.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0178.wav|In eighteen thirty-two the dissection of bodies cut down from the gallows, which had been decreed centuries previously, was abolished;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0179.wav|the most recent enactment in force was the ninth George the fourth cap. thirty-one, which directed the dissection of all bodies of executed murderers,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0180.wav|the idea being to intensify the dread of capital punishment. That such dread was not universal or deep-seated may be gathered from the fact
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0181.wav|that authentic cases were known previous to the first cited act of criminals selling their own bodies to surgeons for dissection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0184.wav|Lord Ferrers' body was brought to Surgeons' Hall after execution in his own carriage and six;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0189.wav|Persons were still living in eighteen fifty-five who had witnessed dissections at Hicks' Hall, and
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0190.wav|whom the horrid scene, with the additional effect of some noted criminals hanging on the walls, drove out again sick and faint,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0191.wav|as we have heard some relate, and with pale and terrified features, to get a breath of air.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0192.wav|The dissection of executed criminals was abolished soon after the discovery of the crime of burking,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0193.wav|with the idea that ignominy would no longer attach to an operation which ceased to be compulsory for the most degraded beings;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0194.wav|and that executors or persons having lawful possession of the bodies
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0195.wav|of people who had died friendless, would voluntarily surrender them for the advancement of medical science.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0198.wav|and her body publicly exhibited in a place built for the purpose in the Old Bailey.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0204.wav|A long procession was formed, headed by constables, who cleared the way with their staves.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0208.wav|erected on the cart, about four feet high at the head, and gradually sloping towards the horse, giving a full view of the body,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0211.wav|and on the right the ripping chisel, with which the murders had been committed, were exposed to view.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0217.wav|or on another specially erected on some commanding spot, had fallen into disuse by eighteen thirty-two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0222.wav|The revival of this barbarous practice caused much indignation in certain quarters,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0226.wav|gaming-tables were set up, cards were played under the gibbet, to the disturbance of the public peace and the annoyance of all decent people.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0233.wav|The rope still broke sometimes, although it was not often that the horrid scene seen at Jersey at the beginning of the century was repeated.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0234.wav|There the hangman added his weight to that of the suspended culprit,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0236.wav|To the great surprise of all who witnessed this dreadful scene,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0238.wav|After this the sheriffs sent for another rope, but the spectators interfered, and the man was carried back to jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0239.wav|The whole case was referred to the king, and the poor wretch, whose crime had been a military one, was eventually pardoned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0242.wav|and the sentence was properly and completely carried out.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0243.wav|Other cases might be quoted,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0247.wav|Similar cases were not wanting as regards the executions before Newgate. Others were not less horrible, although there was no failure of apparatus.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0252.wav|On the scaffold he made a violent attempt to loosen his bonds, and succeeded in getting his hands free.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0255.wav|The miserable wretch during the whole of this time was struggling with the most determined violence, to the great horror of the spectators.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0256.wav|Still he resisted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0257.wav|and having got from the falling drop to the firm part of the platform, he nearly succeeded in tearing the handkerchief from his eyes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0259.wav|The wretched man did not fall with it, but jumped on to the platform, and seizing the rope with his hands, tried to avoid strangulation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0262.wav|The crowd vociferously yelled their disapproval, and at length
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0263.wav|the executioner forced the struggling criminal from the platform, so that the rope sustained his whole weight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0265.wav|Even now his sufferings were not at an end,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0269.wav|his chest heaved, and it was evident that his struggle was a fearful one.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0272.wav|He was in consequence so weak when brought out for execution, that he had to be carried by four men,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0273.wav|two supporting his body and two his legs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0274.wav|His wretched, abject condition, seated in a chair under the drop, was such as almost to unnerve the executioner Calcraft,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0275.wav|who bad been further upset by a letter threatening to shoot him when he appeared to perform his task.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0278.wav|Bousfield slowly drew himself up, and rested with his feet on the right side of the drop.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0291.wav|He was always known as a mild-mannered man of simple tastes, much given to angling in the New River, and a devoted rabbit fancier.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0292.wav|He was well known in the neighborhood where he resided, and the street gamins cried "Jack Ketch" as he went along the street.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0298.wav|which sets forth that the petitioner had been at great expense by sending clerks and agents to Liverpool and Shrewsbury to hire an executioner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0299.wav|The man to be hanged belonged to Wales, and no Welshman would do the job.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0300.wav|Traveling expenses of these agents cost fifteen pounds, and another ten pounds were spent in the hire of a Shropshire man,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0301.wav|who deserted, and was pursued, but without success.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0302.wav|Another man was hired, himself a convict, whose fees for self and wife were twelve guineas.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0005.wav|taking in preference those which are typical and invested with peculiar interest. It is somewhat remarkable that a marked change soon comes over the Calendar.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0007.wav|Police protection was better and more effective;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0008.wav|the streets of London were well lighted, the suburbs were more populous and regularly patrolled.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0009.wav|People, too, were getting into the habit of carrying but little cash about them, and no valuables but their watches or personal jewelery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0011.wav|This led to a rapid and marked increase in all kinds of fraud;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0012.wav|and prominent in the criminal annals of Newgate in these later years will be found numerous remarkable instances of this class of offense --
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0013.wav|forgeries committed systematically, and for long periods, as in the case of Fauntleroy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0015.wav|for the purpose of misappropriating funds or feloniously obtaining cash;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0018.wav|jewel-boxes cleverly stolen under the very noses of owners or care-takers.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0024.wav|While the varying conditions of social life thus brought about many changes in the character of offenses against property,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0025.wav|those against the person became more and more limited to the most heinous, or those which menaced or destroyed life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0032.wav|Pegsworth, and Greenacre, and Daniel Good merely reproduced types that had gone before, and that have since reappeared.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0033.wav|Esther Hibner was as inhuman in her ill-usage of the parish apprentice she killed as Martha Brownrigg had been.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0060.wav|to let the coach change and pass Petticoat Lane en route to the jail, where the suffering woman might be handed over to her friends.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0063.wav|By-and-by the turnkeys, sobered by their loss, returned to Newgate alone, and pleaded in excuse that they had been drugged.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0085.wav|The chest was opened to give change, and a heavy tray lifted out which plainly held some four thousand pounds in cash.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0113.wav|After their arrest, Jordan's wife and Sullivan's brother came to the inn, and begged to be allowed to visit this room;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0145.wav|Solomons was now also admitted as a witness, and his evidence, with that of Moss, secured the transportation of the principal actors in the theft.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0147.wav|Moss peached because he declared he had been done out of the proper price of the gold-dust; but it was clear that he had tried to appropriate the whole of the stuff,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0209.wav|he was annoyed with his man for various small omissions and acts of forgetfulness, and on the night of the murder had taken Courvoisier to task rather sharply.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0210.wav|Finally, on coming downstairs after bed-time, Lord William had found Courvoisier in the dining-room.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0213.wav|This seems to have decided Courvoisier,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0214.wav|who took a carving-knife from the sideboard in the dining-room, went upstairs to Lord William's bedroom, and drew the knife across his throat.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0216.wav|His account of his acts and movements after the deed
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0217.wav|varied so considerably in the several documents he left behind, that too much reliance cannot be placed upon his confession.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0220.wav|that Courvoisier was idle, discontented, ready to take offense, greedy of gain;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0222.wav|he did not shrink from murder, both for revenge and to conceal his other crimes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0224.wav|The attempt was to have been made by opening a vein and allowing himself to bleed to death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0227.wav|The order was, however, at length obeyed, and the whole of the prisoner's clothes were minutely searched.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0228.wav|In the pocket of the coat Mr. Cope, the governor, found a neatly-folded cloth, and asked what it was for.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0229.wav|Courvoisier admitted that he had intended to bind it tightly round his arm and bleed himself to death in the night.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0232.wav|The prisoner replied that he had left it in the mattress of which he had just been deprived.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0233.wav|The bed was searched, but no piece of sharpened wood was found. It was thought that it might have been lost in changing the mattresses.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0234.wav|The cloth above referred to belonged to the inner seam of his trousers, which he had managed to tear out.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0237.wav|Daniel Good's crime might have remained long undiscovered but for his own careless stupidity.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0239.wav|At the same time he was seen to steal and secrete a pair of trousers. The shop-boy gave information.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0243.wav|Good now offered to go to Wandsworth and satisfy the pawnbroker.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0244.wav|Just at this moment, however, the searchers found concealed under two trusses of hay a woman's headless and dismembered trunk.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0246.wav|Some time elapsed before the imprisoned party could force open the doors, and by then the fugitive had escaped.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0248.wav|At the same time an overpowering odor attracted them to the adjoining harness-room, where the missing remains were raked out
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0249.wav|half consumed in the ashes of a wood fire.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0250.wav|In the same room a large axe and saw were found covered with blood.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0251.wav|Inquiry into the character of Good exposed him as a loose liver, who "kept company" with several women.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0253.wav|with a son of Good's by a former wife. Another wife, real or fictitious, existed in Spitalfields,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0255.wav|The victim was the first of these three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0256.wav|Good had told her, much to her perturbation, that she was to move from South Street to Roehampton, and one day he fetched her.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0257.wav|They were seen together on Barnes Common, and again in Putney Park Lane, where they were talking loud and angrily.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0259.wav|The actual method of the murder was never exactly ascertained.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0262.wav|The woman where he lodged noticed that he was very restless at night, moaning and sighing much. Detection came unexpectedly.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0264.wav|In his effects were found the clothes he had on at the time of his escape from the stables, and under the jacket he was wearing
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0266.wav|Good was committed to Newgate, and tried at the Central Criminal Court before a crowded court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0267.wav|He made a rambling defense, ending by saying,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0268.wav|Good ladies and gentlemen all, I have a great deal more to say, but I am so bad I cannot say it.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0002.wav|Hocker's murder is in its way interesting, as affording another proof of the extraordinary way in which the culprit returned to the scene of his guilt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0003.wav|The cries of his victim, a Mr. Delarue,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0007.wav|He entered into conversation with the policemen, and learnt, as it seemed for the first time, what had happened.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0008.wav|His remark was, "It is a nasty job;" he took hold of the dead hand, and confessed that he felt "queer" at the shocking sight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0009.wav|This sight was his own handiwork,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0010.wav|yet he could not overcome the strange fascination it had for him, and remained by the side of the corpse till the stretcher came.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0012.wav|It was here that the others engaged in their dismal office in removing the dead first got a good look at the stranger's face.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0013.wav|He wanted a light for a cigar, and got it from a lantern which was lifted up and fully betrayed his features.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0016.wav|A letter, which afforded an additional clue, was also found in the pocket of the deceased. Still it was many weeks before any arrest was made.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0018.wav|It came out by degrees that the person who had been seen in Belsize Lane on the night the body was found was a friend of the deceased.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0019.wav|His name was Hocker; he was by trade a ladies' shoemaker; and it was also ascertained that after the day of the murder he was flush of money.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0021.wav|a coat among them much torn and stained, with three buttons missing, one of which corresponded with that picked up at Hampstead.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0022.wav|The letter found in the pocket of the deceased was sealed with a wafer marked F,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0023.wav|and many of the same sort were found in the possession of the accused. This was enough to obtain a committal,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0024.wav|after several remands; but the case contained elements of doubt, and the evidence at the trial was entirely circumstantial.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0028.wav|and he was in possession, the first time to her knowledge, of a watch.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0029.wav|This was Delarue's watch, fully identified as such, which Hocker told his brother Delarue had given him the morning of the murder.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0031.wav|The prisoner made an elaborate defense, in which he sought to vilify the character of deceased
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0032.wav|as the seducer of an innocent girl to whom he (Hocker) had been fondly attached.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0033.wav|When her ruin was discovered her brother panted for revenge.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0035.wav|in a lonely part of Hampstead.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0038.wav|and proceeding to where they came from, found Delarue dead, slain by the furious brother.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0041.wav|Such an extravagant defense did not weigh with judge or jury;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0042.wav|the first summed up dead against the prisoner, and the latter, after retiring for ten minutes, found him guilty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0043.wav|Hocker's conduct in Newgate while under sentence of death was most extraordinary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0045.wav|that Delarue had suffered by the hands of imaginary outraged brothers acting as the avengers of females deeply injured by him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0046.wav|Hocker made several pretended confessions and revelations, all of which were proved to be absolutely false by the police on inquiry.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0053.wav|Soon afterwards, in Gloucestershire,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0055.wav|Next year John Gleeson Wilson, at Liverpool, murdered a woman, Ann Henrichson, also a maidservant and two children;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0057.wav|London did not escape the contagion, and prominent among the detestable crimes of the period stands that of the Mannings at Bermondsey.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0061.wav|and Manning hoped to get some small Government appointment through his wife's interest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0063.wav|After the marriage a close intimacy was still maintained between O'Connor and the Mannings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0068.wav|At last this fiendish woman made up her mind to murder O'Connor and appropriate all his possessions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0069.wav|Her husband, to whom she coolly confided her intention,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0070.wav|a heavy brutish fellow, was yet aghast at his wife's resolve, and tried hard to dissuade her from bad purpose.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0071.wav|In his confession after sentence he declared that she plied him well with brandy at this period,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0076.wav|He was seen afterwards smoking and talking with his hosts in their back parlor, and never seen again alive.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0077.wav|It came out in the husband's confession that Mrs. Manning induced O'Connor to go down to the kitchen to wash his hands, that she followed him to the basement,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0078.wav|that she stood behind him as he stood near the open grave she herself had dug for him,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0079.wav|and which he mistook for a drain, and that while he was speaking to her she put the muzzle of a pistol close to the back of his head and shot him down.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0080.wav|She ran upstairs, told her husband, made him go down to look at her handiwork, and as O'Connor was not quite dead,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0081.wav|Manning gave the coup de grace with a crowbar.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0083.wav|which, having possessed herself of the murdered man's keys, she rifled from end to end.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0088.wav|This was on a Thursday evening.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0089.wav|For the remainder of that week and part of the next the murderers stayed in the house, and occupied the kitchen, close to the remains of their victim.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0090.wav|On the Sunday Mrs. Manning roasted a goose at this same kitchen fire, and ate it with relish in the afternoon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0092.wav|The hole must have been excavated and the quicklime purchased quite three weeks before O'Connor met his death,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0095.wav|On the third day his friends began to inquire for him,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0096.wav|and at their request two police officers were sent to Bermondsey to inquire for him at the Mannings, with whom it was well known that he was very intimate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0097.wav|The Mannings had seen or heard nothing of him, of course. As O'Connor still did not turn up, the police after a couple of days returned to Minver Place.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0098.wav|The house was empty, bare and stripped of all its furniture, and its former occupants had decamped.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0099.wav|The circumstance was suspicious, and a search was at once made of the whole premises.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0102.wav|The stones were at once taken up;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0105.wav|He was lying on his face, his legs tied up to his hips so as to allow of the body fitting into the hole.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0106.wav|The lime had done its work so rapidly that the features would have been indistinguishable but for the prominent chin and a set of false teeth.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0107.wav|The corpse settled all doubts, and the next point was to lay hands upon the Mannings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0109.wav|Part of this she had deposited to be left till called for at one station, while she had gone herself to another, that at Euston Square.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0110.wav|At the first the boxes were impounded, opened, and found to contain many of O'Connor's effects.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0111.wav|At the second exact information was obtained of Mrs. Manning's movements. She had gone to Edinburgh.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0115.wav|and they had given information to the police.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0116.wav|Her arrest was planned, and, when the telegram arrived from London, completed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0117.wav|An examination of her boxes disclosed a quantity of O'Connor's property.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0118.wav|Mrs. Manning was transferred to London and lodged in the Horsemonger Lane Jail, where her husband soon afterwards joined her.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0119.wav|He had fled to Jersey, where he was recognized and arrested.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0125.wav|Mrs. Manning was not without personal charms;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0130.wav|Manning, when sentence of death was passed on him, said nothing;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0131.wav|but Mrs. Manning, speaking in a foreign accent, addressed the court with great fluency and vehemence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0134.wav|that O'Connor had been more to her than her husband, that she ought to have married him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0139.wav|and would have left the dock had not Mr. Cope, the governor of Newgate, restrained her.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0140.wav|After judgment was passed she repeatedly cried out Shame!
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0141.wav|and stretching out her hand, she gathered up a quantity of the rue which, following ancient custom dating from the days of the jail fever,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0146.wav|They had to handcuff her by force against the most violent resistance, and still she raged and stormed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0150.wav|and expressed the utmost contempt for her husband, whom she never intended to acknowledge or speak to again.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0153.wav|After this, until the day of execution, she recovered her spirits, and displayed reckless effrontery,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0155.wav|Now she abused the jury, now called Manning a vagabond,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0156.wav|and through all ate heartily at every meal, slept soundly at nights, and talked with cheerfulness on almost any subject.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0157.wav|Nevertheless, she attempted to commit suicide by driving her nails, purposely left long, into her throat.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0158.wav|She was discovered just as she was getting black in the face.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0160.wav|elucidated all dark and uncertain points in connection with the crime.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0162.wav|But it may be mentioned that the concourse was so enormous that it drew down the well-merited and trenchant disapproval of Charles Dickens,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0166.wav|faded in my mind before the atrocious bearing, looks, and language of the assembled spectators.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0174.wav|But it was supposed that he had been once in a good position, well born, and well educated.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0175.wav|When lying under sentence of death in Newgate, he was visited by a lady, a gentlewoman in every sense of the word, who was said to be his sister.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0177.wav|and he must have been at the end of his resources when he committed the crime for which he suffered.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0193.wav|Escorted by his two captors, Marley was taken back into Parliament Street to the jeweler's shop.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0194.wav|The policemen were now in possession;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0199.wav|there was no case to make out; why waste money on lawyers for the defense? His demeanor was cool and collected throughout;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0200.wav|he seemed while in Newgate to realize thoroughly that there was no hope for him, and was determined to face his fate bravely.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0201.wav|After sentence, the Newgate officers who had special charge of him noticed that he slept well and ate well, enjoying all his meals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0202.wav|One of them went into his cell just at dinner-time;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0203.wav|the great clock of St. Sepulchre's close by was striking the hour, and Marley, who had his elbows on the table,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0204.wav|with his head resting on his hands, looked up and observed calmly, "Go along, clock; come along, gallows."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0206.wav|His captors, it may be added (Lerigo and Allen), were warmly commended by the judge for their courage and activity.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0207.wav|The former was given a reward of twenty and the latter of ten pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0210.wav|Cannon, by trade a chimney-sweep, had long been characterized by the bitterest hatred of the police force,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0213.wav|Dwyer found Cannon bleeding profusely from a wound in the head, and persuaded him to go to a doctor's.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0217.wav|Dwyer managed to overpower his assailant, and got to his feet; but Cannon butted at him with his head, and again threw him to the ground,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0219.wav|Once more Dwyer got to his feet, and managed, by drawing his staff, to keep Cannon at bay until a second constable came to his aid.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0275.wav|but it was long before the public realized that the fraudulent clerk and the great theatrical manager were one and the same person.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0280.wav|But it was proved that Watts had appropriated one cheque for fourteen hundred pounds,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0286.wav|The sentence of the court, one of ten years' transportation, struck the prisoner with dismay.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0292.wav|His health improved, but was still indifferent when he was brought up for sentence, and he was an occupant of the Newgate infirmary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0293.wav|He returned from court in a state of gloomy dejection,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0297.wav|The prison officers were called, but Watts was quite cold and stiff when he was cut down.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0298.wav|Strange to say, a second suicide occurred in Newgate the same night,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0300.wav|Sentence of death had been recorded against Donovan, who, like Watts, had seemingly been overcome with sudden despair.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0301.wav|In eighteen fifty-three a second case of gigantic fraud alarmed and scandalized the financial world.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0302.wav|It outshone the defalcations of Watts.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0309.wav|Few realized that these mysterious operations were the "convulsive attempt" of a ruined and dishonest speculator to sustain his credit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0311.wav|His extensive business had been carried on by fraud.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0312.wav|His method was to obtain advances twice over on the same bills of lading or corn warrants. The duplicates were forged.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0314.wav|Pries at length was discovered
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0316.wav|Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0317.wav|Pries was lodged in Newgate, tried at the Old Bailey, and transported for life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0321.wav|When such goods arrived they were frequently left at a wharf, paying rent until it suited the importer to remove them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0323.wav|The warrant thus represented money, and was often used as such, being endorsed and passed from hand to hand as other negotiable bills.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0324.wav|Cole's plan was to have a wharf of his own, nominally occupied by a creature trading as Maltby and Co.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0325.wav|Goods would be landed at this wharf;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0330.wav|He had several narrow escapes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0331.wav|Once a warrant-holder sent down a clerk to view certain goods, and the clerk found that these goods had already a "stop" upon them, or were pledged.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0332.wav|Cole escaped by throwing the blame on a careless partner, and at once removed the "stop."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0337.wav|wishing to verify the value of warrants they held, and sending to Maltby and Co.'s wharf, found out half the truth.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0340.wav|They could not deny that the latter was the truth, and were forthwith stigmatized by Mr. Chapman, Overend and Gurney's representative, as rogues.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0005.wav|About this time Davidson and Gordon, the people above-mentioned,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0006.wav|who had fraudulent warrants out of their own to the extent of one hundred fifty thousand pounds, suspended payment and absconded.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0010.wav|Cole now suspended payment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0014.wav|Davidson and Gordon were also sentenced to imprisonment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0017.wav|for the fraudulent disposal of securities lodged in their hands. This firm was one of the oldest banking establishments in the kingdom,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0018.wav|and dated back to the Commonwealth, when, under the title of Snow and Walton, it carried on business as pawnbrokers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0019.wav|The Strahan of the firm which came to grief was a Snow who changed his name for a fortune of two hundred thousand pounds;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0020.wav|he was a man esteemed and respected in society and the world of finance, incapable as it was thought of a dishonest deed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0021.wav|Sir John Dean Paul had inherited a baronetcy from his father, together with an honored name;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0022.wav|he was himself a prominent member of the Low Church, of austere piety, active in all good works.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0025.wav|The bank enjoyed an excellent reputation, it had a good connection, and was supposed to be perfectly sound.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0029.wav|In December eighteen fifty-one the balance sheet showed a deficiency of upwards of seventy thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0030.wav|The bank had been conducted on false principles;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0032.wav|and on the other by backing up
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0033.wav|an impecunious and rotten firm of contractors with vast liabilities and pledged to impossible works abroad.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0034.wav|The engagements of the bank on these two heads amounting to nearly half a million of money,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0036.wav|The bank was already insolvent,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0038.wav|They chose, unhappily for themselves, the latter alternative.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0039.wav|Money they must have, and money they raised to meet their urgent necessities upon the balances and securities deposited with them by their customers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0041.wav|and the various discount houses would not advance sufficient sums to relieve the necessities of the bank.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0043.wav|This went on for some time, and might never have been discovered had some good stroke of luck provided any of the partners
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0045.wav|the firm's paper went down further and further in value; an application to the Committee of Bankers for assistance was peremptorily refused,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0046.wav|then came a run on the bank, and it was compelled to stop payment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0047.wav|Its debts amounted to three-quarters of a million, and the dividend it eventually paid was three and twopence in the pound.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0049.wav|They admitted that they had made away with many of the securities entrusted to their keeping.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0050.wav|Following this, warrants were issued for their arrest,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0051.wav|the specific charge being the unlawful negotiation of Danish bonds and other shares belonging to the Rev. Dr. Griffiths of Rochester

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0057.wav|All three were tried at the Central Criminal Court, and sentenced to fourteen years' transportation, passing some time in Newgate en route.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0059.wav|Two cases of extensive embezzlement which were discovered almost simultaneously, those of Robson and Redpath,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0061.wav|They both reproduced many of the features of the case of Watts, already described,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0062.wav|but in neither did the sums misappropriated reach quite the same high figure.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0066.wav|His proclivities were theatrical, and he was the author of several plays,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0067.wav|one at least of which, 'Love and Loyalty,' with Wallack in a leading part, achieved a certain success.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0068.wav|He began life as a law-writer, earning thereby some fifteen or eighteen shillings a week;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0069.wav|but the firm he served got him a situation as clerk in the office of the Great Northern Railway,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0070.wav|whence he passed to a better position under the Crystal Palace Company.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0071.wav|He now married, although his salary was only a pound a week; but he soon got on.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0077.wav|He was not the first man of loose morality and expensive tastes
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0079.wav|The temptation was all the greater because the chances of successful fraud lay ready to hand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0085.wav|With the proceeds of these flagitious frauds Robson feasted and made merry.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0086.wav|He kept open house at Kilburn Priory;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0087.wav|entertained literary, artistic, and dramatic celebrities; had a smart "turn out," attended all the race-meetings, and dressed in the latest fashion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0088.wav|To his wife, poor soul, he made no pretense of fidelity, and she enjoyed only so much of his company as was necessarily spent
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0089.wav|in receiving guests at home, or could be spared from two rival establishments in other parts of the town.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0093.wav|he replied gaily that his regular work at the Crystal Palace office was useful as a sort of discipline, and kept him steady.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0103.wav|Mr. Fasson, more and more ill at ease, would not accept this subterfuge, and declared they must be found.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0104.wav|Robson again left him, but only to gather together hastily all the money and valuables on which he could lay his hands, with which he left the house.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0106.wav|A reward was forthwith offered for Robson's apprehension.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0107.wav|Meanwhile the absconding clerk had coolly driven to a favorite dining-place in the West End,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0111.wav|then, accompanied by a lady, not Mrs. Robson, he took steamer and started for Copenhagen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0112.wav|But the continental police had been warned to look out for him, and two Danish inspectors got upon his track,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0114.wav|Thence he was transferred to Copenhagen and surrendered in due course to a London police officer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0117.wav|Sergeant Ballantine, who prosecuted,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0118.wav|paid him the compliment of describing him as "a young man of great intelligence, considerable powers of mind,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0119.wav|and possessed of an education very much beyond the rank of life to which he originally belonged."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0120.wav|Robson was found guilty, and sentenced to two terms of transportation, one for twenty and one for fourteen years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0123.wav|In many respects the embezzlement of which Leopold Redpath was guilty closely resembled that of Robson,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0126.wav|This offered him great facilities for the creation of artificial stock, its sale from a fictitious holder, and transfer to himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0129.wav|by inserting say one before five hundred, and thus making it
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0130.wav|fifteen hundred pounds, which larger amount was duly carried to his credit on the register, and entered upon the certificates of transfer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0132.wav|The total amount was never exactly made out, but the false stock created and issued by him was estimated at two hundred twenty thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0133.wav|Even when the bubble burst Redpath, who had lived at the rate of twenty thousand a year,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0136.wav|First a lawyer's clerk, he then got an appointment in the Peninsular and Oriental Company's office;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0138.wav|His fault was generosity,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0140.wav|After his bankruptcy he obtained a place as clerk in the Great Northern Railway office,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0141.wav|from which he rose to be assistant registrar, with the special duties of transferring shares.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0142.wav|He soon proved his ability, and by unremitting attention mastered the whole work of the office.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0143.wav|Later on he became registrar, and in this more independent position
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0145.wav|Now he launched out into great expenditure, took a house in Chester Terrace, and became known as a Maecenas and patron of the arts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0147.wav|Leading social and artistic personages were to be met with at his house, and his hospitality was far famed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0149.wav|peas at ten shillings a quart, five-guinea pines, and early asparagus were to be found on his table.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0153.wav|Not content with giving where assistance was solicited, he himself sought out deserving cases and personally afforded relief.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0154.wav|When the crash came there were pensioners and other recipients of his bounty who could not believe
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0157.wav|During the days of his prosperity he was a governor of Christ's Hospital,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0158.wav|of the St. Ann's Society, and one of the supporters and managers of the Patriotic Fund.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0159.wav|In his person he was neat and fastidious;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0160.wav|he patronized the best tailors, and had a fashionable coiffeur from Hanover Square daily to curl his hair.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0162.wav|Just after Robson's frauds had agitated the minds of all directors of companies, the chairman of the Great Northern (Mr. Denison)
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0167.wav|Redpath had industriously circulated reports that he had prospered greatly in speculation;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0170.wav|Redpath was called in and informed of the intended investigation. He tried to stave off the evil hour by declaring that everything was perfectly right;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0171.wav|but finding he could not escape, he said he would resign his post, and leaving the boardroom, disappeared.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0172.wav|The inquiry soon revealed the colossal character of the frauds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0173.wav|Warrants were issued for Redpath's arrest, but he had flown to Paris.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0176.wav|He was arrested, examined before a police magistrate, and committed to Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0177.wav|Great excitement prevailed in the city and the West End when Redpath's defalcations were made public.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0178.wav|The Stock Market was greatly affected, and society, more especially that which frequents Exeter Hall, was convulsed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0179.wav|The Central Criminal Court, when the trial came on,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0182.wav|and thoroughly embodying the idea of English respectability.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0183.wav|His manner was generally self-possessed, but his face was marked with "uneasy earnestness,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0185.wav|When the jury found a verdict of guilty he remained unmoved. He listened without emotion to the judge's well-merited censures,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0186.wav|and received his sentence of transportation for life without much surprise.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0187.wav|Redpath passed away into the outer darkness of a penal colony, where he was still living a year or two back
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0188.wav|But his name lingers still in this country as that of the first swindler of his time,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0189.wav|and the prototype of a class not uncommon in our later days
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0190.wav|that of dishonest rogues who assume piety and philanthropy as a cloak for their misdeeds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0194.wav|and behaved so as to justify a belief that he had been a jail-bird all his life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0195.wav|It has been already remarked in these pages that with changed social conditions came a great change in the character of crimes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0198.wav|It was no longer possible to stop a coach or carriage, or rob the postman who carried the mail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0200.wav|only when single and unprotected were they in any danger of attack, and that but rarely.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0201.wav|There were still big prizes, however, to tempt the daring, and none appealed more to the thievish instinct than the custom of transmitting gold by rail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0202.wav|The precious metal was sent from place to place carefully locked up and guarded, no doubt;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0206.wav|He laid the suggestion before Agar, a professional thief, who was of opinion it contained elements of success.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0207.wav|But the collusion and active assistance of employees of the railway carriers were indispensable, and together
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0209.wav|Burgess detailed the whole system of transmission.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0214.wav|At the other side of the Channel the French railway authorities took charge.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0216.wav|This was an important step, and they might easily be robbed some day when Burgess was the guard, provided only that they could be opened.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0217.wav|The next step was to get impressions and fabricate false keys.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0219.wav|At last he decided to enlist one Tester, a clerk in the traffic department, whom he thought would prove a likely tool.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0220.wav|The four waited patiently for their opportunity,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0221.wav|which came when the safes were sent to Chubbs' to be repaired; and Chubbs sent them back, but only with one key,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0222.wav|in such a way that Tester had possession of this key for a time.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0224.wav|the difficulty was to get a copy of the second key.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0225.wav|This was at length effected by Agar and Pierce.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0226.wav|After hanging about the Folkestone office for some time, they saw at last that the key was kept in a certain cupboard.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0229.wav|who quickly took the wax impression, handed it back to Pierce; Pierce replaced it, left the office, and the thing was done.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0231.wav|It was Tester's business, who had access to the railway company's books, to watch for this.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0233.wav|A weight of shot was bought and stowed in carpet bags ready to replace exactly the abstracted gold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0236.wav|Burgess admitted him into the guard's van, where he fitted and filed the keys till they worked easily and satisfactorily in the locks of the safe.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0238.wav|The thieves took first-class tickets, handed their bags full of shot to the porters, who placed them in the guard's van.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0241.wav|opened it, took out and broke into the bullion box, removed the gold, substituted the shot from a carpet bag,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0242.wav|re-fastened and re-sealed the bullion box, and replaced it in the safe.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0243.wav|At Redhill Tester met the train and relieved the thieves of a portion of the stolen gold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0245.wav|The two remaining safes were attacked and nearly entirely despoiled in the same way as the first, and the contents transferred to the courier bags.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0246.wav|The train was now approaching Folkestone, and Agar and Pierce hid themselves in a dark part of the van.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0247.wav|At that station the safes were given out, heavy with shot, not gold; the thieves went on to Dover, and by-and-by,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0249.wav|The theft was discovered at Boulogne, when the boxes were found not to weigh exactly what they ought. But no clue was obtained to the thieves,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0252.wav|When he knew that he could not escape his fate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0253.wav|he handed over to Pierce a sum of three thousand pounds, his own, whether rightly or wrongly acquired never came out,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0255.wav|and begged his accomplice to invest it as a settlement on a woman named Kay, by whom he had had a child.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0256.wav|Pierce made Kay only a few small payments, then appropriated the rest of the money.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0257.wav|Kay, who had been living with Agar at the time of the bullion robbery,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0259.wav|Agar too, in Newgate, heard how Pierce had treated him, and at once readily turned approver.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0261.wav|The whole strange story, the long incubation and the elaborate accomplishment of the plot,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0263.wav|Scarcely had the conviction of these daring and astute thieves been assured, than another gigantic fraud was brought to light.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0268.wav|Instead of following an honorable profession, he preferred to turn his great natural talents and ready wits to the most nefarious practices.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0269.wav|He was known to the whole criminal fraternity as a high-class receiver of stolen goods, a negotiator more especially of stolen paper,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0272.wav|and it was to him that Agar, Pierce, and the rest applied when seeking to dispose of their stolen bullion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0280.wav|was the return from transportation of an old "pal" and confederate, who brought with him some bills of exchange.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0282.wav|Like his great predecessor Old Patch, he never went to a bank himself, nor did any of his accomplices.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0284.wav|In order to obtain messengers of this sort, Saward answered advertisements of persons seeking employment,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0285.wav|and when these presented themselves, entrusted them as a beginning with the duty of cashing cheques.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0286.wav|A confederate followed the emissary closely,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0289.wav|As each transaction was carried out from a different address, and a different messenger always employed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0292.wav|One named Hardwicke assumed the name of Ralph, and, to obtain commercial credit in Yarmouth, paid in two hundred fifty pounds to a Yarmouth bank
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0295.wav|he was told it was only at Mr. Whitney's disposal, and that it could be paid to no one else.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0297.wav|and that clever schemer sent an elaborate letter of instructions how to ask for the money.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0298.wav|But while Hardwicke was in communication with Saward, the bank was in communication with London
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0299.wav|and the circumstances were deemed sufficiently suspicious to warrant the arrest of the gentlemen at Yarmouth on a charge of forgery and conspiracy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0302.wav|who was at length taken in a coffee-shop near Oxford Street, under the name of Hopkins. He resisted at first, and denied his identity,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0304.wav|He then confessed that he was the redoubtable Jem Saward, or Jem the Penman, and was conveyed to a police-court, and thence to Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0307.wav|The evidence was corroborated by that of many of the victims who had acted as messengers,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0310.wav|which had received so perverted and mistaken direction,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0311.wav|had not been guided by a sense of virtue, and directed to more honorable and useful pursuits.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0312.wav|The proceeds of these forgeries amounted, it was said, to some thousands per annum.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0314.wav|He was in person a short, square-built man of gentlemanly address, sharp and shrewd in conversation and manner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0002.wav|The old notion always prevailed that Newgate was impregnable, so to speak, from within,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0003.wav|and that none of its inmates could hope to escape from its secure precincts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0006.wav|The inspectors' reports mention many cases of evasion accomplished.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0016.wav|There is an attempt at escape mentioned in Mr. Wakefield's book, which might have been an intended suicide.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0017.wav|John Williams, a young fellow only twenty-three years of age, awaited execution in eighteen twenty-seven for stealing in a dwelling-house.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0018.wav|On the very morning on which he was to suffer he eluded the vigilance, such as it was, of his officers
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0021.wav|Although his execution was imminent, a surgeon attended to his wounds, and he was carried more dead than alive to the scaffold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0022.wav|A harrowing scene followed;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0023.wav|the wounds broke open and bled profusely while the last dread penalty was being performed, to the manifest excitement and indignation of the crowd.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0024.wav|A more daring and skilful escape was effected in eighteen thirty-six by the chimney-sweep Henry Williams,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0025.wav|who, while detained in the press-yard as a capital convict, under sentence of death for burglary,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0026.wav|managed to get away in the very same spot where his namesake had nine years before so miserably failed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0028.wav|and would certainly have been impossible to any one less nimble than a chimney-sweep, trained under the old system to ascend the most intricate flues.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0029.wav|Even after Williams had got out, persons were disposed to disbelieve that the escape had been accomplished in the manner indicated;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0031.wav|Yet from the circumstantial account given by Williams after recapture, there can be little doubt that he got away as will be described.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0034.wav|In one corner of the airing yard stood a cistern at some height from the ground;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0036.wav|About fifty feet from the ground level, and above the cistern, a revolving chevaux-de-frise of iron was fixed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0037.wav|with only a short interval between it and the wall, supported by a horizontal iron railing with upright points;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0038.wav|in the wall above the chevaux-de-frise projected a series of iron spikes sharp enough to forbid further ascent.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0041.wav|and working with his hands behind him, while he used his bare feet like claws upon the other side of the wall angle.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0042.wav|The condition of the stone surface just mentioned assisted him in this, and he managed to get beyond the cistern to the railing below the chevaux-de-frise.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0044.wav|and was compelled to work along the railing round three-quarters of the square of the yard,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0045.wav|and at length reached a point opposite the top of the building containing the condemned wards. This had been a perilous and painful task;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0056.wav|running a great risk of discovery as he passed by a lot of workmen at Tyler's manufactory in Warwick Square, which had formerly been the College of Physicians.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0057.wav|As his coat was an encumbrance, he left it on the top of the third house in Newgate Street, and thus in shirt-sleeves, barefoot and bareheaded,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0058.wav|he worked along to the roofs in Warwick Lane.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0059.wav|Here he came upon a woman on the leads hanging out clothes to dry.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0060.wav|Williams concealed himself behind a chimney till she had re-entered her garret,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0061.wav|and then following her down a step ladder into the house, told his story, appealed to and won her compassion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0062.wav|She suffered him to pass downstairs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0063.wav|Below he met another woman and a girl, both of whom were terrified at his appearance, but
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0064.wav|when he explained that he was running away from the gallows they left him the road clear.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0067.wav|he tramped across London Bridge to Wandsworth, where he refreshed himself with a pint of strong ale, the first sustenance he had taken since his escape,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0068.wav|and continued his march to Kingston, where he slept soundly under a hedge till next morning.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0069.wav|Entering a town, he obtained employment at once as a chimney-sweep
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0071.wav|Dissatisfied with this remuneration, he again took to the road, and tramped into Hampshire,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0072.wav|where he presently committed a burglary at Lymington, was caught, and lodged in Winchester Jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0074.wav|The success, although very short-lived, which attended him, no doubt inspired other inmates of Newgate to follow his example.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0076.wav|Even then, however, irons across barred the ascent after a certain distance, and in no one case did a fugitive get clear away.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0078.wav|but had to come down again covered with soot and filth just as the officers entered the ward.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0081.wav|On another occasion Mr. Cope the governor came in and missed a man.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0084.wav|the fugitive, uncomfortably ensconced in the flue, came down of his own accord, like Colonel Colt's raccoon.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0088.wav|working at the roof of the chapel on the female side.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0089.wav|He was engaged in whitewashing and cleaning; the officer who had him in charge left him on the stairs leading to the gallery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0090.wav|Taking advantage of being unobserved, he got out through the roof on to the leads, and traveled along them towards Number one, Newgate Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0092.wav|He stepped in at a garret window, coolly walked downstairs, and entered the bar.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0093.wav|They asked him how he had cut his hand, which was bleeding, and he said he had done it while working up on the roof.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0094.wav|No further notice was taken of him; no one seemingly suspected that he was a prisoner, and he was suffered to walk off without let or hindrance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0095.wav|In eighteen fifty-three three men escaped in company from one of the wards in the middle yard.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0096.wav|They were penal servitude men, their names Bell, Brown, and Barry, and they were awaiting transfer to Leicester,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0097.wav|which with Wakefield was utilized as a receptacle for convicts not going to Western Australia,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0098.wav|or any of the new establishments at home, at Portland, Dartmoor, or elsewhere.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0099.wav|These men managed to cut a hole in the ceiling of the ward near the iron cage on the landing, and so got access to the roof.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0100.wav|At that time rope mats were still used as beds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0101.wav|One of the three, shamming ill, remained all day in his ward, where he employed himself unraveling the rope from the sleeping-mats.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0104.wav|whence they let themselves down into the street by the rope.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0105.wav|These men were all in prison dress at the time of their escape, but one of their number, Bell, sent back his clothes a few days later by parcel's delivery,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0106.wav|with a civil note to the governor, saying he had no further use for them. All three fugitives were recaptured,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0107.wav|Brown almost at once; then Barry, who was taken at the East End in a public-house where he had arranged to meet a pal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0109.wav|but not till they had had an exciting chase down the street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0111.wav|The officers dropped on to him while he was still in bed, but as they came upstairs he jumped up and hid in a cupboard.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0114.wav|A later case was still more remarkable, as it was effected after the alteration of the prison and its reconstruction on the newest lines.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0118.wav|Through the aperture he crept out on to the landing at the dead of night, and so down into the central space of the building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0121.wav|Krapps walked at once into the yard and across to the female side, where he found some of the washing still hanging out to dry.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0126.wav|The top of the wall was gained without difficulty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0129.wav|Down below were market-carts waiting for daylight, and among them Krapps found a refuge and friends.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0130.wav|The first intimation of his escape was afforded by the police, who informed the prison authorities next day that a rope was hanging down from the cook-house roof.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0131.wav|Nothing more was heard of Krapps. The curious thing in his case was that his offense was a trifling one;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0132.wav|he was still untried, but would almost certainly have escaped with a minor penalty, say of three or four months' imprisonment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0134.wav|Cases well authenticated have been known of men who had all but completed their sentences, and for whom the prison gates would open within a few days,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0135.wav|who yet faced extraordinary risks to advance their enlargement by only a few hours.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0137.wav|that numbers of men, "lifers," and others with ten, fourteen, or twenty years to do, can be trusted to work out of doors without bolts and bars
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0142.wav|who permitted him to go up on to the roof of the old wards, in order to throw water for flushing purposes down a shoot.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0144.wav|He had disappeared.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0148.wav|This was not strong enough to carry him, and he fell through.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0150.wav|Suicides at Newgate were numerous enough, but they seldom possessed any novel or unusual features;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0151.wav|prison suicides seldom do, except as regards ingenuity and determination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0152.wav|Only great resolution indeed, persisted in to the bitter end,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0155.wav|braces, shoe-strings, shirt torn into strips are the only instruments, and a bar or small hook
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0157.wav|One curious instance of a suicide carried out under the most adverse and extraordinary circumstances may be quoted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0158.wav|It was that of a "Long Firm" swindler, by name Johnson,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0162.wav|he fastened one end of the strap above mentioned to the hook, and then fell down.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0166.wav|and surgical opinion stated that the stoppage of circulation was the cause of death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0170.wav|greater attention was paid to the capital convicts, and the horrors of their situation while awaiting sentence
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0171.wav|were as far as possible mitigated and toned down. But there was little improvement in the ceremony itself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0173.wav|was not always to be trusted to do his fell work efficiently.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0174.wav|Having mentioned Calcraft's name,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0175.wav|I may be permitted to digress for a moment to give a few particulars concerning the last officially appointed hangman of the city of London.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0177.wav|Marwood, whose name is so familiar with the present generation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0178.wav|had no official status, and was merely an operator selected by the Corporation, and who, on the strength of it,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0179.wav|contracted with sheriffs and conveners to work by the job.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0182.wav|he was a shoemaker by trade, and settled in London after his marriage in eighteen twenty-five.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0190.wav|"I have no idea who the sheriffs will get to do the work after me," said Foxen, adding that his assistant, Tom Cheshire,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0192.wav|"I think I could do that sort of job," said Calcraft, on the spur of the moment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0193.wav|Foxen asked him his name and address, and went away.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0194.wav|Calcraft thought no more of what had occurred till the next sessions at the Old Bailey, when the sheriffs sent for him,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0195.wav|and offered him the post of executioner for the city of London and Middlesex.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0196.wav|He accepted, having at first Tom Cheshire as his assistant, then for a time, when Cheshire was dismissed for drunkenness, a man named Osborne.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0199.wav|It was customary to make the executioner take the Bible in his hand, and swear solemnly that he would dispatch every criminal condemned to die,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0200.wav|without favoring father or mother or any other relation or friend.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0202.wav|Calcraft's emoluments were a guinea per week, and an extra guinea for every execution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0204.wav|For acting as executioner of Horsemonger Lane Jail
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0205.wav|he received a retaining fee of five pounds, five shillings, with the usual guinea for each job;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0207.wav|It was not always easy to get a hangman so cheap, as I have already indicated on a previous page.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0209.wav|Some wags in Scotland seized Calcraft and kept him in durance the night before the execution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0210.wav|Meanwhile the convener or sheriff was in despair, expecting that, failing the executioner, he would have to do the job himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0212.wav|Calcraft's salary was more than the proverbial "thirteenpence halfpenny -- hangman's wages."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0215.wav|The mark was valued at thirteenpence halfpenny, or rather more than the shilling, which from time immemorial had been the hangman's wages.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0216.wav|That very ancient perquisite the convict's clothes was never claimed by Calcraft, and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0219.wav|He expressly bequeathed them to Calcraft, who was graciously pleased to accept them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0221.wav|Calcraft consented, got and bestowed the clothes, only to find that the person he had obliged exhibited them publicly.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0223.wav|Capital convicts go to the gallows in their own clothing, and not in prison dress, unless the former is quite unfit to be worn.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0225.wav|which his predecessors were not, and who were paid their wages over the gate to obviate the necessity for letting them enter.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0226.wav|To this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared, "the yeoman of the halter,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0229.wav|He kept no record of them, and when asked questions, referred to the officers of the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0234.wav|he was not unskilful, but he proceeded entirely by rule of thumb, leaving the result very much to chance and the strength of the rope.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0239.wav|Marwood till latterly seemed to have done his work more effectually, and has been known to give as much as six feet fall.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0240.wav|This generally produces instantaneous death, although cases where complete fracture of the spinal cord occurred are said to be rare.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0241.wav|Calcraft served the city of London till eighteen seventy-four, when he was pensioned at the rate of twenty-five shillings per week.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0242.wav|The last execution at which he acted was that of Godwin, on the twenty-fifth May, eighteen seventy-four.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0243.wav|Marwood, who succeeded him, and who died while these sheets were in the press, was a Lincolnshire man, a native of Horncastle,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0246.wav|Over the door, in gilt letters, were the words "Crown Office"; in the window was a pile of official envelopes, ostentatiously displayed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0247.wav|while round about were shoe-strings, boot-laces, and lasts. Marwood, strange to say, followed the same trade as Calcraft.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0248.wav|Marwood was proud of his calling, and when questioned as to whether his process was satisfactory, replied that he heard "no complaints."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0249.wav|The strange competition amongst hundreds to succeed Marwood is a strange fact too recently before the public to need mention here.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0250.wav|It may, however, be remarked that the wisdom of appointing any regular hangman is very open to question,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0253.wav|that the ceremony may be made more mechanical, thus rendering the personal intervention of a skilled functionary unnecessary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0254.wav|Executions long continued to be in public, in spite of remonstrance and reprobation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0255.wav|The old prejudices, such as that which enlisted Dr. Johnson on the side of the Tyburn procession, still lingered and prevented any change.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0256.wav|It was thought that capital punishment would lose its deterrent effect if it ceased to be public,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0257.wav|and the raison d'être of the penalty, which in principle so many opposed, would be gone.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0263.wav|Few, if any, showed any feeling of terror, none were impressed with the solemnity, or realized the warning which the sight conveyed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0264.wav|The upturned faces of the eager spectators resembled those of the 'gods' at Drury Lane on Boxing Night;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0268.wav|The remarks heard amongst the crowd were of coarse approval.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0273.wav|At Müller's execution there was great competition for front seats,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0274.wav|and the windows of the opposite houses, which commanded a good view, as usual fetched high prices.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0276.wav|Never, indeed, had an execution been more generally patronized.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0277.wav|This is proved by contemporary accounts, especially one graphic and realistic article which appeared in the 'Times,'
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0282.wav|"Till three o'clock it was one long revelry of songs and laughter, shouting, and often quarreling, though,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0284.wav|There were preachers among the crowd, but they could not get a patient hearing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0286.wav|Oh, my! Think I've got to die.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0287.wav|This was presently superseded by a fresh catch --
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0288.wav|"Müller, Müller, He's the man," till a diversion was created by the appearance of the gallows, which was received with continuous yells.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0291.wav|sharpers, thieves, gamblers, betting men, the outsiders of the boxing ring,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0293.wav|with the rakings of cheap singing-halls and billiard-rooms, the fast young men of London.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0294.wav|But all, whether young or old, men or women, seemed to know nothing, feel nothing, to have no object but the gallows, and to laugh,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0296.wav|The actual execution made some impression.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0305.wav|Already the urgent necessity for abolishing public executions had been brought before the House of Commons by Mr. Hibbert,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0306.wav|and the question, as part of the whole subject of capital punishment, had been referred to a royal commission in January eighteen sixty-four.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0311.wav|that any secrecy in the treatment of the condemned would invest them with a new and greater interest, which was much to be deprecated.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0317.wav|but believed that a public ceremony destroyed the whole value of an execution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0319.wav|The only doubts expressed were as to the sufficiency of the safeguards, as to the certainty of death and its subsequent publication.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0321.wav|Duly impressed with the weight of evidence in favor of abolition,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0322.wav|the commission recommended that death sentences should be carried out within the jail, under such regulations as might be considered necessary
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0323.wav|to prevent abuse, and satisfy the public that the law had been complied with.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0324.wav|But it is curious to note that there were several dissentients among the commissioners to this paragraph of the report.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0354.wav|and the ordinary, in a voice trembling with emotion, read the burial service aloud.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0357.wav|No time was lost in carrying out the dread ceremony; but it was not completed without some of the officials turning sick, and the moment it was over,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0364.wav|all the ghastly paraphernalia, the gallows itself and the process of erecting and removing it, rested with the city architect, and not with the prison officials.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0035.wav|in the interests and for the due protection of the public, that the fullest and fairest inquiry should be made,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0036.wav|that the trial was transferred to the Central Criminal Court,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0037.wav|under the authority of an Act passed on purpose, known as the Trial of offenses Act, and sometimes as Lord Campbell's Act.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0039.wav|is obviously of paramount importance, and the powers granted by this Act have been frequently put in practice since.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0042.wav|Palmer's trial caused the most intense excitement.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0043.wav|The direful suspicions which surrounded the case filled the whole country with uneasiness and misgiving,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0044.wav|and the deepest anxiety was felt that the crime, if crime there had been, should be brought home to its perpetrator.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0050.wav|Palmer, who was only thirty-one at the time of his trial, was in appearance short and stout, with a round head
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0052.wav|His skin was extraordinarily fair, his cheeks fresh and ruddy; altogether his face, though commonplace, was not exactly ugly;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0053.wav|there was certainly nothing in it which indicated cruel cunning or deliberate truculence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0056.wav|Although the strain lasted fourteen days, he showed no signs of exhaustion, either physical or mental.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0057.wav|On returning to jail each day he talked freely and without reserve to the warders in charge of him, chiefly on incidents in the day's proceedings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0058.wav|He was confident to the very last that it would be impossible to find him guilty;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0065.wav|I ought also to confess the others: I mean my wife and my brother's. End quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0066.wav|Yet he was silent when specifically pressed to confess that he had killed his wife and his brother.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0069.wav|Originally a doctor in practice at Rugeley, in Staffordshire, he had gradually withdrawn from medicine, and devoted himself to the turf;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0070.wav|but his sporting operations did not prosper, and he became a needy man, always driven to desperate straits for cash.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0072.wav|whose signature he counterfeited.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0076.wav|His brother was supposed to have been his next victim, upon whose life he had also effected an insurance for another thirteen thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0077.wav|The brother too died conveniently, but the life office took some exception to the manner of the death, and hesitated to disburse the funds claimed by Palmer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0078.wav|Palmer tried to get a new insurance on the life of a hanger-on, one Bates, but no office would accept it, no doubt greatly to Bates's longevity.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0079.wav|Meanwhile the bill discounters who held the forged acceptances, with other promissory notes, began to clamor for payment, and talk of issuing writs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0080.wav|Palmer, alive to the danger he ran of a prosecution for forgery, should the fraud he had committed be brought to light,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0081.wav|sought about for a fresh victim to supply him with funds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0082.wav|He fixed upon a sporting friend, Mr. John Parsons Cook, who had been in luck at Shrewsbury races, both as a winner and a backer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0083.wav|whom he persuaded to go and stay at Rugeley in an hotel just opposite his own house.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0089.wav|While Cook lay ill, Palmer in his name pocketed the proceeds of the Shrewsbury settling,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0091.wav|The last act now approached, and in order to avoid the detection of this last fraud, Palmer laid his plans for disposing of Cook.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0092.wav|He decided to use strychnia, or the vegetable poison otherwise known as nux vomica;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0093.wav|and one of the many links in the long chain of evidence was an entry in a book of Palmer's to the effect that Quote.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0095.wav|The purchase by Palmer of strychnia was proved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0100.wav|Next night Cook had a second and a more violent attack.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0101.wav|That day Palmer had bought more strychnia, and had called in a fresh doctor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0104.wav|prescribed nominally by the fresh doctor, for which Palmer had substituted his own.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0106.wav|fearful paroxysms and cramps, ending in suffocation by the tetanic rigor which caught the muscles of the chest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0109.wav|while the muscles of the fingers were tightly clenched, not open, as usual in a corpse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0111.wav|that his friend had died greatly embarrassed, with bills to the amount of four thousand pounds out in his name.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0112.wav|Palmer too showed an indecent haste in preparing the body for interment, and in obtaining the usual certificate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0113.wav|After this the step-father insisted upon a post-mortem, which was conducted somewhat carelessly.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0114.wav|The intestines were, however, preserved and sent for analysis,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0115.wav|but it was proved that Palmer tried hard to get possession of the jar containing them,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0116.wav|and even sought to upset the vehicle by which they were being conveyed a part of the way to London.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0118.wav|and it was on the entire absence of the latter that the defense was principally based when Palmer was brought to trial.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0123.wav|There was not much reserve about him when there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0124.wav|He frequently declared before and during the trial that it would be impossible to find him guilty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0125.wav|He never actually said that he was not guilty, but he was confident he would not be convicted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0129.wav|Even after the death sentence had been passed upon him he clung to the hope that the Government would grant him a reprieve.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0130.wav|To the last, therefore, he played the part of a man wrongfully convicted, and did not abandon hope
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0131.wav|even when the high sheriff had told him there was no possibility of a reprieve, and within a few hours of execution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0132.wav|He suffered at Stafford in front of the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0133.wav|Palmer speedily found imitators.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0136.wav|with exquisite torture, and with a poison that would leave, as he thought, no trace.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0137.wav|In the latter hope he was happily disappointed. But as this case is beyond my subject, I merely mention it as one of the group already referred to.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0138.wav|Three years later came the case of Dr. Smethurst,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0140.wav|In both the jury had no doubt as to the guilt of the accused, only in Smethurst's case the then Home Secretary, Sir George Cornewall Lewis,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0142.wav|Smethurst's escape may have influenced the jury in the Poplar poisoning case,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0145.wav|Dr. Smethurst was long an inmate of Newgate, and was tried at the Central Criminal Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0148.wav|Smethurst's victim was a Miss Bankes, with whom he had contracted a bigamous marriage.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0150.wav|and whom he left without scruple to join Miss Bankes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0151.wav|The latter seems to have succumbed only too willingly to his fascinations, and to have as readily agreed to marry him,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0152.wav|in spite of the existence of the other Mrs. Smethurst.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0154.wav|that Mrs. Smethurst had no right to the name, but had a husband of her own, one Johnson, alive -- a story subsequently disproved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0156.wav|and told her sister as much when they last met.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0161.wav|But probably the lump sum was the bait, or perhaps Smethurst wished to return to his temporarily deserted first wife.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0162.wav|Whatever the exact cause which impelled him to crime, it seems certain that he began to give her some poison,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0163.wav|either arsenic or antimony, or both, in small quantities,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0167.wav|Smethurst was found guilty by the jury, and sentenced to death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0168.wav|But a long public discussion followed, and in consequence he was reprieved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0169.wav|The Home Secretary, in a letter to the Lord Chief Baron, stated that, quote, although the facts are full of suspicion against Smethurst,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0170.wav|there is not absolute and complete evidence of his guilt. End quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0171.wav|Smethurst was therefore given a free pardon for the offense of murder,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0174.wav|She was tried in April eighteen sixty-two on suspicion of having attempted to poison a neighbor with oil of vitriol.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0175.wav|The circumstances were strange. Mrs. Wilson had gone to the chemist's for medicine,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0177.wav|Wilson was acquitted on this charge, but other suspicious facts cropped up while she was in Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0178.wav|It appeared that several persons with whom she was intimate had succumbed suddenly.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0180.wav|vomiting, violent retching, purging, such as are visible in cholera, and all dated from the time when she knew a young man named Dixon,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0183.wav|Soon afterwards Dixon died, showing all the symptoms already described.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0184.wav|Soon afterwards a friend, Mrs. Atkinson, came to London from Westmoreland, and stayed in Mrs. Wilson's house.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0187.wav|Her husband, who came up to town, would not allow a post-mortem, and again Mrs. Wilson escaped.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0190.wav|After this came the charge of administering oil of vitriol, which failed, as has been described.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0191.wav|Last of all Mrs. Wilson poisoned her landlady, Mrs. Soames, under precisely the same conditions as the foregoing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0193.wav|It was proved that Mrs. Wilson had given Mrs. Soames something peculiar to drink,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0195.wav|and that Mrs. Wilson administered the same medicine again and again.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0196.wav|The last time Mrs. Soames showed great reluctance to take it, but Wilson said it would certainly do her good.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0197.wav|This mysterious medicine Wilson kept carefully locked up, and allowed no one to see it,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0198.wav|but its nature was betrayed when this last victim also died.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0199.wav|The first post-mortem indicated death from natural causes,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0214.wav|most of them, as was proved by their subsequent acts, blackguards of the deepest dye.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0215.wav|Six were Spaniards, or rather natives of Manilla, and men of color; one was a Greek, another a Turk;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0218.wav|The captain was kindly but somewhat intemperate, the first mate a man of some determination,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0221.wav|eight truculent and reckless scoundrels, who, brooding over their fancied wrongs, and burning for revenge,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0222.wav|hatched amongst them a plot to murder their officers and seize the ship.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0224.wav|A simultaneous attack was made upon the captain and the first mate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0225.wav|The latter had the watch on deck.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0226.wav|One half of the mutineers fell upon him unawares with handspikes and capstan-bars.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0228.wav|till every feature was obliterated, and then, still living, flung him into the sea.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0229.wav|Meanwhile the captain, roused from his berth,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0231.wav|His body was found lying in a pool of blood in a night-dress, stabbed over and over again in the left side.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0232.wav|The captain's brother, a passenger on board the 'Flowery Land,' was also stabbed to death and his body thrown overboard.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0235.wav|He was soon summoned on deck, but as he would not move, the mutineers came down and stood in a circle round his berth.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0242.wav|Leon wished to make every one on board share and share alike, so as to implicate the innocent with the guilty;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0243.wav|but Vartos, or Watto, the Turk, would not allow any but the eight mutineers to have anything.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0249.wav|The boats reached the shore on the fourth October. Leon had prepared a plausible tale to the effect that they belonged to an American ship
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0250.wav|from Peru bound to Bordeaux, which had foundered at sea;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0251.wav|that they had been in the boats five days and nights, but that the captain and others had been lost.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0255.wav|repaired there secretly, and so gave information to the Brazilian authorities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0256.wav|The mutineers were arrested, the case inquired into by a naval court-martial,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0010.wav|Inside the carriage was a hat, a walking-stick, and a small black leather bag.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0013.wav|There was a deep wound just over the ear, the skull was fractured, and there were several other blows and wounds on the head.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0014.wav|Strange to say, the unfortunate man was not yet dead, and he actually survived more than four-and-twenty hours.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0016.wav|T. Briggs, Esq., Robarts and Co., Lombard Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0022.wav|It was also easily established that the hat found in the carriage had been bought at Walker's, a hatter's in Crawford Street,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0023.wav|Marylebone; while within a few days Mr. Briggs' gold chain was traced to a jeweler's in Cheapside,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0025.wav|More precise clues to the murderer were not long wanting; indeed the readiness with which they were produced and followed up
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0027.wav|In little more than a week a cabman came forward and voluntarily made a statement which at once drew suspicion to a German, Franz Müller,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0031.wav|This fixed the crime pretty certainly upon Müller, who had already left the country, thus increasing suspicion under which he lay.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0035.wav|This was the 'City of Manchester,' which was expected to arrive some days before the 'Victoria,' and did so.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0041.wav|The case was one of circumstantial evidence, but, as Sir Robert Collyer the Solicitor-General pointed out,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0042.wav|it was the strongest circumstantial evidence which had ever been brought forward in a murder case.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0043.wav|It was really evidence of facts which could not be controverted or explained away.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0045.wav|An alibi was set up for the defense, but not well substantiated, and the jury without hesitation returned a verdict of guilty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0047.wav|He adhered to this almost to the very last. His case had been warmly espoused by the Society for the Protection of Germans in this country,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0049.wav|Müller knew that any confession would ruin his chances of escape.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0050.wav|His arguments were specious and evasive when pressed to confess. "Why should man confess to man?" he replied;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0051.wav|man cannot forgive man, only God can do so. Man is therefore only accountable to God.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0052.wav|But on the gallows, when the cap was over his eyes and the rope had been adjusted round his neck, and within a second of the moment when he would be launched into eternity,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0053.wav|he whispered in the ear of the German pastor who attended him on the scaffold,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0054.wav|While in the condemned cell he conversed freely with the warders in broken English or through an interpreter.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0055.wav|He is described as not a bad-looking man, with a square German type of face,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0057.wav|He was short in stature, his legs were light for the upper part of his body, which was powerful, almost herculean.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0058.wav|It is generally supposed that he committed the murder under a sudden access of covetousness and greed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0059.wav|He saw Mr. Briggs' watch-chain, and followed him instantly into the carriage, determined to have it at all costs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0060.wav|His crime under this aspect of it was less premeditated, and less atrocious therefore, than that of Lefroy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0061.wav|One other curious murder may be added to the two foregoing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0062.wav|Christian Sattler was by birth a German.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0063.wav|He had led a wild life; had left his native land and enlisted first in the French army in Algeria,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0064.wav|afterwards in the British German Legion raised for the Crimean War.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0067.wav|Thither, he was pursued by a detective officer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0068.wav|Inspector Thain, who, being unable to obtain his extradition legally, had him inveigled on board an English steamer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0069.wav|where the arrest was made.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0073.wav|This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0076.wav|As Sattler brooded over his wrongs, his rage got the upper hand, and he resolved to wreak it upon Thain.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0079.wav|The unfortunate man survived till he landed, but died in Guy's Hospital.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0082.wav|he had yielded to an irresistible impulse to kill him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0085.wav|He would shoot any man or any policeman like a dog, or any number of them, who had treated him in that way.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0086.wav|His demeanor immediately preceding his execution I have referred to in the last chapter.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0088.wav|I propose next to describe the leading features of the most important of these.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0091.wav|Wagner and Bateman, who had already been convicted of systematic forgery, and sentenced to transportation, but they had been released on ticket-of-leave
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0092.wav|in eighteen fifty-six.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0093.wav|As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0097.wav|At length a man was caught in the act of passing a forged cheque at the Union Bank,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0098.wav|and recognized as one of the frequenters of the bogus law-stationers. His arrest led to that of others.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0099.wav|Among them was a man named Chandler, formerly a bill discounter by profession, who by degrees, to meet his extravagant expenditure,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0101.wav|Chandler while in Newgate turned informer, and betrayed the whole conspiracy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0102.wav|Besides his employers, a jeweler named Humphreys was in the "swim," at whose shop in Red Lion Square was discovered a quantity of base gold
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0104.wav|also a furniture dealer and one or two more commonplace rogues. The arch villain was never taken into custody.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0105.wav|He, like Saward, was an artist in penmanship.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0106.wav|He was a German named Kerp,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0107.wav|eighty years of age, who had spent his whole life in imitating other people's signatures, and had acquired the most consummate skill in the practice.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0109.wav|The aged but wary Kerp, the moment the plot was discovered, vanished, and was never more heard of.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0111.wav|They advertised for clerks, and employed the most likely of the applicants by sending them to the bank.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0112.wav|It was one of these, Glendinning, who had allowed himself to be utilized for some time in this way, whose capture led to the breaking up of the gang.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0114.wav|the others to twenty and ten years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0116.wav|and that the forged cheques which had been presented, but refused, amounted to double the sum.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0117.wav|Wagner, after conviction, offered to reveal, for a reward of three thousand pounds
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0118.wav|a system which had long been in practice of defrauding the Exchequer of vast sums by means of forged stamps.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0119.wav|His offer was not, however, accepted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0122.wav|but not before the forged paper had been put in circulation for more than a couple of years. In eighteen sixty-one,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0124.wav|where are Messrs. Portal's mills for the manufacture of bank-note paper.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0125.wav|Burnett had only just come out of jail after completing a sentence of penal servitude.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0126.wav|His object in visiting Whitchurch was to undermine the honesty of some workman in the mills;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0127.wav|and he eventually succeeded, his wife making the first overtures, in persuading a lad named Brown to steal some of the bank paper.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0130.wav|and stole paper on a much larger scale than Brown.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0131.wav|All that was taken was handed over to Burnett, or a "woman in black" whom Brown met by appointment at Waterloo station.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0132.wav|To facilitate his operations, Brewer obtained a false master key from Burnett,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0134.wav|In this part of the mills a large quantity of bank-note paper was kept at the period of the robbery,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0136.wav|One more remains, that of "glazing," without which no paper is issued for engraving.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0137.wav|None of the stolen paper was glazed, and this was an important clue to the subsequent discovery of the crime.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0138.wav|Some time in eighteen sixty-two, a large deficiency in stock of bank paper unglazed was discovered at the mills.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0139.wav|Soon afterwards the inspectors of bank-notes at the Bank of England detected the presentation at the bank of spurious notes on genuine paper.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0140.wav|The two facts taken in conjunction
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0142.wav|By this time Brown alone had stolen three or four hundred sheets,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0143.wav|each containing two notes, many of the sheets suitable for engraving any kind of note from one thousand pounds downwards.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0145.wav|Suspicion appears to have rested on Brown, who had left Laverstock,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0146.wav|and he was soon approached by the police. Almost directly he was questioned he made a clean breast of the whole affair.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0149.wav|Buncher was then tracked to North Kent Terrace, New Cross, where a Mr. and Mrs. Campbell resided,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0150.wav|with whom he did business in exchanging the false notes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0151.wav|The police officers now taxed Mrs. Campbell with complicity, and frightened her into collusion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0153.wav|the officers ensconced themselves in the latter, and waited for Buncher's expected visit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0156.wav|after using much intemperate language, he left the place in a huff.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0159.wav|This was all the police wanted to know.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0160.wav|They next watched Buncher, and found that he paid frequent visits to Birmingham.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0162.wav|he had been introduced to a man named Griffiths, an engraver and copper-plate printer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0166.wav|Buncher in London, and Griffiths in Birmingham.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0167.wav|Nothing was found in Buncher's premises in Strutton Ground, which were thoroughly searched,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0171.wav|"Mother plates" for engraving the body of the notes lay about, and other plates for various processes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0172.wav|More than this, Griffiths took the police to a field where, in a bank, a number of other plates were secreted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0175.wav|This was penal servitude for life, Buncher's sentence being twenty-five, and Burnett's twenty years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0177.wav|But as there was no independent corroboration of the informer's evidence, according to the custom of the British law,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0178.wav|the case was considered not proved, and he was acquitted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0179.wav|On his return to Newgate to be finally discharged, Cummings jumped up the stairs and fairly danced for joy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0182.wav|and no more bodies were to be bought
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0185.wav|A Bow Street officer saw him leaving London in the evening by Camberwell Green, accompanied by two other men.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0186.wav|It was well known that they were resurrectionists, and a strict watch was kept at all the turnpike gates on the southern roads leading into London.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0187.wav|An officer was placed for this purpose at New Cross, Camberwell, and Kennington gates.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0188.wav|Presently "Old Bob" drove up to Camberwell Gate in the same cart in which he had been seen to start.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0189.wav|The officers rushed out to detain him. "What have you got here? We must search the cart," they cry.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0191.wav|Bob was therefore allowed to pass on.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0192.wav|But they had the body, all the same; it had been dressed up in decent clothes and made to stand upright in the cart.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0194.wav|Cummings was repeatedly "run in" for the offense of coining and uttering bad money, whether coin or notes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0195.wav|His regular trade, followed before he took to the life of resurrectionist, was that of an engraver.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0196.wav|He was a notorious criminal,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0200.wav|He went there with a posse of officers and forced his way upstairs to the first floor,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0201.wav|where the coiners, unexpectedly disturbed, fell an easy prey.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0203.wav|Proceeding cautiously down the stairs, they found that the flooring at the bottom had been taken up.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0204.wav|Where it had lain was a yawning gulf or trap sufficient to do for the whole body of police engaged in the capture.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0205.wav|Cummings was caught shortly afterwards.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0206.wav|He was a tall, slender man, with a long face and iron-gray hair.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0207.wav|The community of coiners of which he was so notorious a member
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0209.wav|It was not easy to detect coiners, or bring home their guilt to them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0212.wav|The annals of fraudulent crime probably contain nothing
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0213.wav|which in dramatic interest can compare with the conviction of William Roupell for forgery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0214.wav|As the case must still be well remembered by the present generation, it will be necessary to give here only the briefest summary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0217.wav|As such he had pretty general control over his father's estates and affairs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0221.wav|but upon this forged and false conveyance William Roupell, who had already embarked upon a career of wild extravagance,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0223.wav|In eighteen fifty-six the father died.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0226.wav|leaving everything to the widow, and constituting William sole executor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0228.wav|Five or six years later, William Roupell minutely described how he had effected the fraud.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0233.wav|To this fraudulent instrument he appended forged signatures, and in due course obtained probate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0235.wav|He embarked forthwith in a career of the wildest extravagance, and ere long he had parted in his mother's name with most of the landed estates.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0237.wav|No fortune could stand the inroads he made into his mother's money,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0238.wav|and in eighteen sixty-two he was obliged to fly the country, hopelessly and irretrievably ruined.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0240.wav|were fictitious documents. His next brother, who should have inherited under the authentic will,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0244.wav|The effect of establishing the forgeries would be to restore to the Roupell family lands for which a price had already been paid
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0245.wav|in all good faith to another, but a criminal member of the family.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0246.wav|At first the case was contested hotly, but, to the profound astonishment of every one inside and outside the court,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0247.wav|William Roupell himself was brought as a principal witness to clench the case by a confession altogether against himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0251.wav|He confessed himself a perjurer in having sworn to the false will, and a wholesale forger, having manufactured no less than ten false signatures
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0253.wav|For these crimes William Roupell was tried at the Central Criminal Court on the twenty-fourth September, eighteen sixty-two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0254.wav|He declined to plead, but a plea of "Not Guilty" was recorded.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0256.wav|Roupell made a long statement more in exculpation than in his defense.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0258.wav|But while repudiating the charges made against him of systematic extravagance and immorality,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0017.wav|This building was a costly affair. The site was uneven, and had to be leveled;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0031.wav|was the moving spirit among these commissioners, and he is now generally recognized as the originator of modern prison architecture.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0038.wav|The cost in each varied considerably, the general average being from one hundred twenty pounds to one hundred thirty pounds per cell.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0039.wav|At Pentonville the rate was higher, but there the expense had been increased by the site,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0048.wav|A new and still imperfectly understood science had arisen,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0049.wav|the principles of which were debated by disputants of widely opposite opinions with an earnestness that sometimes bordered upon acrimony.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0051.wav|the other supported the theory of labor in association, but under a stringent rule of silence, with isolation only at night.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0052.wav|Both systems came to us from the United States. The difference was really more in degree than in principle,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0054.wav|But about eighteen fifty the two sides were distinctly hostile, and the controversy ran high.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0055.wav|High authorities were in favor of continuous separation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0057.wav|was the true basis of a sound system of prison discipline.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0061.wav|Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0064.wav|that their condition was more natural, and approximated more nearly to that of daily life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0065.wav|Better industrial results were obtained from it, and instruction in trades was easier, and prisoners were more likely to leave jail
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0067.wav|The opposing champions were not slow to find faults and flaws in the system they condemned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0068.wav|Separation was injurious to health, mental or physical, said one side; men broke down when subjected to it for more than a certain period,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0069.wav|and it was unsafe to fix this limit above twelve months, although some rash advocates were in favor of eighteen months, some indeed of two years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0070.wav|The other side retorted that the system of associated labor was most costly, so many officers being required to maintain the discipline of silence;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0071.wav|moreover, it was nearly impossible to prevent communication and mutual contamination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0072.wav|It is scarcely necessary to follow the controversy further. I have only introduced the subject as showing how little as yet the State
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0073.wav|was impressed with the necessity for authoritative interference.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0074.wav|The legislature was content to let local jurisdictions experimentalize for themselves; with the strange, anomalous result,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0075.wav|that a thief or other criminal might be quite differently treated according as he was incarcerated on one side or another of a border line.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0080.wav|some were not sufficiently ventilated, others were warmed artificially, and were unwholesomely close.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0083.wav|The discipline also varied greatly, from the severely penal to the culpably lax.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0088.wav|There was no general rule of employment. Hard labor was often not insisted upon in separate confinement;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0091.wav|were mere matters of chance, and decided according to the views of the local magistracy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0094.wav|Opinions differed greatly with regard to the tread-wheel; some authorities advocated it as a very severe and irksome punishment,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0097.wav|This want of uniformity in prison discipline became ere long an acknowledged evil pressing for some remedy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0098.wav|and the question was once more taken up in the House of Commons. In eighteen forty-nine Mr. Charles Pearson, M.P.,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0099.wav|moved for a committee to report upon the best means of securing some uniform system which should be "punitive, reformatory, and self-supporting;"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0101.wav|In eighteen fifty Sir George Grey brought forward a new motion to the same effect,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0103.wav|The latter had reference more especially to a proposal emanating from Mr. Charles Pearson himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0104.wav|That gentleman had come to the conclusion that the ordinary and hackneyed methods of treatment were practically inefficacious,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0108.wav|The prisoners were to cultivate the land and raise sufficient produce for their own support.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0111.wav|healthful, easily learnt, and well adapted to the circumstances of unskilled laborers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0112.wav|Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0114.wav|but Mr. Pearson overlooked some points in which a more practical mind would have foreseen difficulty, and perhaps forecasted failure.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0116.wav|anticipating the best results from a system which made earnings, and indeed release, dependent upon the amount of work done.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0117.wav|That industry might thus be stimulated and encouraged was probable enough,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0119.wav|but Mr. Pearson hardly considered the converse sufficiently, and
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0122.wav|Mr. Pearson seems to have taken for granted that all prisoners would behave well in his district prisons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0123.wav|On that account he made no provision to insure safe custody,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0126.wav|The creation of an expensive staff for supervision,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0127.wav|or the still more costly process of walling in the whole farm, would have greatly added to the charges of these establishments.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0128.wav|I have lingered too long perhaps over Mr. Pearson's proposal, but some reference was indispensable to a scheme
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0130.wav|since admirably developed in the convict prisons of this country.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0132.wav|in the inquiry which followed, attention was again attracted to Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0134.wav|radical improvement was generally considered impossible. The great evil, however, had been sensibly diminished.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0137.wav|The prison population of Newgate was still subject to great fluctuations, but it seldom rose above two hundred and fifty or three hundred
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0138.wav|at the most crowded periods, or just before the sessional jail delivery; and at its lowest it fell sometimes to fifty or sixty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0139.wav|These numbers would have still further decreased, and the jail would have been almost empty, but for the misdemeanants who were still sent to Newgate
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0140.wav|at times on long terms of imprisonment, and for the transports, whom the Home Office were often, as of old, slow to remove.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0141.wav|The old wards, day rooms and sleeping rooms combined, of which the reader has already heard so much,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0143.wav|Drinking and gaming,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0145.wav|But reformation was only skin deep. Below the surface many of the old evils still rankled.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0147.wav|this occurred in summer at eight, but in the winter months it took place at dusk, and was often as early as four or five.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0150.wav|Captain Williams, who was the inspector of prisons for the home district in succession to Messrs. Crawford and Russell,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0151.wav|stated in evidence that he was visiting Newgate one night, when he heard a great disturbance in one of the day and sleeping rooms,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0152.wav|and on entering it found the prisoners engaged in kicking bundles of wood from one end of the ward to the other.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0153.wav|Some attempt at supervision was exercised by the night watchman stationed on the leads, who might hear what went on inside.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0156.wav|Unless the guilty prisoner was given up, the whole ward was punished, either by the exclusion of visitors or the deprivation of fire,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0158.wav|Later on a more efficacious but still imperfect method of supervision was introduced. Iron cages, which are still to be seen in Newgate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0159.wav|were constructed on the landings, ensconced in which warders spent the night, on duty, and alert to watch the sleepers below,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0160.wav|and check by remonstrance or threat of punishment all who broke the peace of the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0162.wav|Other changes affecting the condition and proper treatment of prisoners were not made until the inspector had urged and recommended them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0164.wav|the personal superintendence of night officers, as already described, became possible.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0165.wav|The rule became general as regards the prison dress; hitherto clothing had been issued only to such as were destitute or in rags, and all classes of prisoners,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0167.wav|wore no distinguishing costume, although its use was admitted, not only for cleanliness, but as a badge of condition, and a security against escape.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0179.wav|This, with a scheme for limiting the jail to untried prisoners, had been urgently recommended by Lord John Russell in eighteen thirty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0180.wav|His letter to the Corporation, under date fourth June,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0182.wav|Lord John Russell, commenting upon the offer of the Corporation to improve Newgate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0184.wav|The Corporation had agreed to spend twenty thousand pounds on alterations, but sixty thousand pounds would suffice to reconstruct.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0187.wav|and he was therefore prepared to submit to Parliament a proposal that half the cost of reconstruction should be borne by public funds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0190.wav|"but in a metropolitan prison absolutely essential." The Corporation in reply demurred rather to accepting strict separation as a rule,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0191.wav|feeling that it approached too nearly to solitary confinement.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0192.wav|The court was, however, prepared to consider Lord John Russell's proposal with regard to the cost of rebuilding;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0195.wav|A proviso was also made that the magistrates should continue to exercise full control over the new jail,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0196.wav|free from any other interference than that of the inspectors on the part of Government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0198.wav|and on a more mature consideration he realized that the limited area of the existing Newgate site,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0203.wav|But the condition of the great city jail was evidently considered a reproach by the city authorities, and a year after the opening of the new "model" at Pentonville,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0204.wav|a serious effort was made to reconstruct Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0205.wav|In eighteen forty-five the Jail Committee brought forward a definite proposal to purchase ground in the immediate vicinity for the erection of a new jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0206.wav|This jail was nominally to replace the Giltspur Street Compter,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0207.wav|The site of which was to be sold to Christ's Hospital, but the intention was of course to embody and absorb old Newgate in the new construction.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0208.wav|The proposal made was to purchase some fifty thousand square feet between Newgate, Warwick Lane, and the Sessions House,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0210.wav|But when this suggestion was brought before the court of aldermen, various amendments were proposed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0211.wav|It was urged that the area selected for purchase must be excessively costly to acquire, and still quite inadequate for the city needs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0212.wav|The Home Secretary had laid it down that at least five acres would be indispensable, and such an area it was impossible to obtain within the limits of the city.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0215.wav|Why not move the city prison bodily into this more rural spot, with its purer air and greater breathing space?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0217.wav|The necessary preliminaries took some time, but the contracts for the new building were completed in eighteen forty-nine, when the works were commenced.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0219.wav|It was to accommodate only the convicted prisoners sentenced to terms short of penal servitude, and after its completion
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0220.wav|the uses of Newgate were narrowed almost entirely to those of a prison of detention.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0222.wav|This principle became more and more generally the rule, although it has never been punctiliously observed. Now and again
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0223.wav|misdemeanants have found their way into Newgate, and within the last few years one offender against the privileges of the House of Commons.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0238.wav|The first "glass house," or room in which prisoners could talk in private with their attorneys, but yet be seen by the warder on the watch, had been constructed
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0240.wav|But no structural alterations were made from the date first quoted until the time of closing the prison in eighteen eighty-one.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0241.wav|But in the interval very comprehensive and, I think it must be admitted, salutary changes were successively introduced into the management of prisons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0242.wav|Newgate naturally shared in any advantages due to these reforms. I propose, therefore, to refer to them in the concluding pages of this work,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0245.wav|The inquiry was most searching and complete, and the committee spoke plainly in its report.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0246.wav|It animadverted strongly on "the many and wide differences as regards construction, labor, diet, and general discipline"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0247.wav|which existed in the various prisons,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0252.wav|while its rigid maintenance was in its opinion vital to the efficiency of the jails.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0253.wav|Even where cells had been built
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0255.wav|Great numbers were not lighted at night, and were without means by which their inmates could communicate, in case of urgent necessity, with their keepers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0256.wav|Still greater were the differences with regard to employment. The various authorities held widely different opinions as to what constituted hard labor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0259.wav|while the former was intended for the congregate labor of a number, and the latter, as its name implies, imposed continuous solitary toil.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0261.wav|With these differences were others as opposed concerning industrial occupation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0262.wav|The jail authorities often gave the highest, possibly undue, importance to the value of remunerative employment,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0263.wav|and sought to make profitable returns from prisoners' labor the test of prison efficiency. In this view the committee could not coincide,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0270.wav|Vegetables, especially the potato, that most valuable anti-scorbutic, was too often omitted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0271.wav|In a word, the value of diet as a part of penal discipline was still insufficiently recognized.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0272.wav|The prisons were still far from inflicting the three punishments, hard labor, hard fare, and a hard bed
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0273.wav|which Sir Joshua Jebb told the committee he considered the proper elements of penal discipline.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0274.wav|It is interesting to note here
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0275.wav|that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0276.wav|during short sentences, or the earlier stages of a long confinement,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0278.wav|This suggestion was adopted in the Act of eighteen sixty-five, which followed the committee's report, and of which more directly.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0280.wav|They are now the universal rule,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0281.wav|introduced, as was erroneously supposed, by the prison commissioners appointed under the Prison Act of eighteen seventy-seven.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0282.wav|Their origin it will be seen dates back much further than that.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0287.wav|They were very numerous, very imperfect in construction and management, and they were very little required.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0290.wav|There were dormitories without light, control, or regulation at night,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0291.wav|which warders, dreading assault, were afraid to enter after dark, even to check rioting and disturbance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0292.wav|Prisoners still slept two in a bed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0293.wav|In one prison the bedsteads had been removed lest the prisoners should break them up and convert them into weapons of offense.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0294.wav|The prison buildings were in many places out of repair; other houses often overlooked them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0297.wav|The prisoners inter-communicated freely, and exercised the most injurious, corrupting influences upon one another.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0298.wav|The total want of administration was very marked,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0301.wav|Some idea of the comparative uselessness of these small borough prisons was conveyed by some figures quoted by the committee.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0304.wav|twenty-two others received between eleven and twenty-five;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0305.wav|fourteen received less than eleven and more than six;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0309.wav|The main object of this act was to compass that uniformity in discipline and treatment generally
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0310.wav|which had long been admitted as indispensable, and had never as yet been properly obtained.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0312.wav|with the local jurisdictions, although still very leniently disposed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0315.wav|also their constant employment in labor appropriate to their condition.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0318.wav|was to be the rule for all convicted prisoners throughout the early stages of their detention;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0320.wav|was the boon to which willing industry extending over a long period established a certain claim.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0321.wav|The infliction of punishment more or less uniform was thus aimed at.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0322.wav|On the other hand, new and careful regulations were framed to secure the moral and material well-being of the inmates of the jails.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0324.wav|The chaplain's duties were enlarged, and the principle of toleration accepted to the extent of securing to all prisoners
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0325.wav|the ministrations of ministers of their own form of belief.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0328.wav|Stringent rules were prescribed for the prison surgeons;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0332.wav|The administration of good government was to be watched over by the local magistracy, certain of whom, styled visiting justices,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0336.wav|His disciplinary powers were defined by the act, and his duties,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0337.wav|both in controlling his subordinates and in protecting the prisoners from petty tyranny and oppression, every one of whom he was to see once every twenty-four hours.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0340.wav|The latter was rendered nearly impossible by the penalties imposed on persons bringing spirituous liquors into the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0341.wav|The old custom, so fruitful of the worst evils, of keeping a tap inside the prison was made illegal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0342.wav|So was the employment of prisoners in any position of trust or authority;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0343.wav|they were not to be turnkeys or assistant turnkeys, neither wardsman nor yardsman, overseer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0344.wav|monitor, or schoolmaster, nor to be engaged in the service of any officer of the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0345.wav|The Act of eighteen sixty-five also encouraged and empowered the local authorities to "alter, enlarge, or rebuild" their prisons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0347.wav|chairman of quarter sessions, or even by a couple of justices.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0348.wav|Every facility was promised. The sanction of the Secretary of State would not be withheld if plans and estimates were duly submitted,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0351.wav|Nor were these the only inducements offered. Where local authorities were indisposed to set their prisons in order,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0352.wav|or hesitated to embark upon any considerable expenditure to alter or rebuild,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0353.wav|they were at liberty to hire suitable cell accommodation from any neighbors who might have it to spare; the only proviso,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0354.wav|That no such contract was valid between one jurisdiction and another unless the Secretary of State was satisfied that the prison it was intended to use
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0356.wav|But the act was not limited to permissive legislation. Its provisions and enactments were backed up by certain penalties.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0357.wav|The Secretary of State was empowered to deal rather summarily with "inadequate" prisons, in other words,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0360.wav|This he might do on the representation of the inspector of prisons,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0363.wav|he could close the "inadequate" prison, by declaring it unfit for the reception of prisoners.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0365.wav|and with the concurrence of the other authority, and on payment. A few provisos governed these rather extensive powers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0366.wav|It was necessary, for instance, to give due notice when the government grant was to be withdrawn,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0369.wav|In the same way, six months' notice was required in cases where the closing of a prison was contemplated;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0370.wav|but if these conditions were observed, the Secretary of State could deal sharply enough with the defaulting jurisdictions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0371.wav|Yet the law was seldom if ever enforced.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0374.wav|It was nearly impossible for them to exercise a very close supervision over the whole of the prisons of the country.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0376.wav|The task imposed upon them, tending as it did to the imposition of a fine upon the local authorities, was not a pleasant one,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0377.wav|and it is not strange if they did not very frequently hand up the offenders to the reproof and correction of the Secretary of State.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0378.wav|As the almost inevitable consequence, while the more glaring defects in prison management disappeared,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0379.wav|matters went on after the eighteen sixty-five Act much the same as they had done before. Districts differed greatly in the attention they paid to prison affairs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0380.wav|In one part the most praiseworthy activity prevailed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0382.wav|As the years passed, great want of uniformity continued to prevail throughout the prisons of the United Kingdom.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0383.wav|The whole question assumed sufficient importance to become a part of the Government program when Lord Beaconsfield took office in eighteen seventy-four.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0385.wav|Mr. (now Sir Richard) Cross, having applied himself vigorously to the task of reorganizing the whole system, became convinced
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0387.wav|The Prisons Bill of eighteen seventy-six contemplated the transfer of the prisons to Government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0398.wav|Accordingly, it was ordered by Sir William Harcourt, the present Secretary of State, that Newgate should cease to be used as a regular prison,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ020-0017.wav|Now whip up the batter with a wooden spoon for another minute, and the sponge is made.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ020-0018.wav|Throw a cloth over the bowl and set by for five or six hours to rise.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ020-0020.wav|When the sponge is light sift a quart and a cup of flour into a bowl or tray with two teaspoonfuls of salt.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0083.wav|six. Projects will be allocated to localities or relief areas in relation to the number of workers on relief rolls in those areas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0087.wav|After the Division of Applications and Information has sifted those projects,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0152.wav|There is likewise pending before the Congress
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0154.wav|I consider this legislation a positive recovery measure.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0160.wav|has lost touch with, and has lost the sympathy of, the communities it pretends to serve.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0164.wav|It will put the public utility operating industry on a sound basis for the future,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0167.wav|but it will protect the actual value and earning power of properties now owned by thousands of investors
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0168.wav|who have little protection under the old laws against what used to be called frenzied finance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0170.wav|Not only business recovery, but the general economic recovery of the nation will be greatly stimulated by the enactment of legislation
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0172.wav|There is need for legislation providing for the regulation of interstate transportation by buses and trucks,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0174.wav|for the strengthening of the Interstate Commerce Commission to enable it to carry out a rounded conception of the national transportation system
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0179.wav|speaking through their government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0180.wav|Wise public policy, however, requires not only that banking be safe
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0182.wav|To this end it was decided more than twenty years ago
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0183.wav|that the government should assume the responsibility of providing a means by which the credit of the nation might be controlled,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0185.wav|The answer to this demand was the Federal Reserve System.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0188.wav|Certain proposals made to amend the Federal Reserve Act deserve prompt and favorable action by the Congress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0194.wav|Never since my inauguration in March, nineteen thirty-three, have I felt so unmistakably the atmosphere of recovery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0197.wav|We have survived all of the arduous burdens and the threatening dangers of a great economic calamity.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0198.wav|We have in the darkest moments of our national trials retained our faith in our own ability to master our destiny.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0200.wav|renewed faith in the vast possibilities of human beings to improve their material and spiritual status
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0201.wav|through the instrumentality of the democratic form of government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0007.wav|I am reminded of that evening in March, four years ago, when I made my first radio report to you.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0008.wav|We were then in the midst of the great banking crisis.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0012.wav|But when, almost two years later, it came before the Supreme Court its constitutionality was upheld only by a five-to-four vote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0013.wav|The change of one vote would have thrown all the affairs of this great Nation back into hopeless chaos.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0014.wav|In effect, four Justices ruled that the right under a private contract
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0021.wav|to make it bomb-proof against the causes of nineteen twenty-nine.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0022.wav|Today we are only part-way through that program
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0023.wav|and recovery is speeding up to a point where the dangers of nineteen twenty-nine are again becoming possible,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0025.wav|National laws are needed to complete that program.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0026.wav|Individual or local or state effort alone cannot protect us in nineteen thirty-seven any better than ten years ago.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0027.wav|It will take time -- and plenty of time -- to work out our remedies administratively even after legislation is passed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0028.wav|To complete our program of protection in time, therefore,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0032.wav|If we learned anything from the depression
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0034.wav|The American people have learned from the depression.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0035.wav|For in the last three national elections
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0036.wav|an overwhelming majority of them voted a mandate that the Congress and the President begin the task of providing that protection
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0037.wav|not after long years of debate, but now.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0039.wav|by meeting squarely our modern social and economic conditions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0040.wav|We are at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0041.wav|It is a quiet crisis. There are no lines of depositors outside closed banks.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0043.wav|I want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0044.wav|the need to meet the unanswered challenge of one-third of a Nation ill-nourished, ill-clad, ill-housed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0047.wav|The three horses are, of course, the three branches of government -- the Congress, the Executive and the courts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0048.wav|Two of the horses are pulling in unison today; the third is not.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0049.wav|Those who have intimated that the President of the United States is trying to drive that team
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0050.wav|overlook the simple fact that the President, as Chief Executive, is himself one of the three horses.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0054.wav|I hope that you have re-read the Constitution of the United States in these past few weeks.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0055.wav|Like the Bible, it ought to be read again and again.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0057.wav|because the Articles of Confederation under which the original thirteen States tried to operate after the Revolution
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0058.wav|showed the need of a national government with power enough to handle national problems.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0059.wav|In its Preamble, the Constitution states that it was intended to form a more perfect Union and promote the general welfare;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0060.wav|and the powers given to the Congress to carry out those purposes can be best described by saying
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0061.wav|that they were all the powers needed to meet each and every problem which then had a national character
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0062.wav|and which could not be met by merely local action.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0064.wav|Having in mind that in succeeding generations many other problems then undreamed of would become national problems
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0068.wav|to have been the clear and underlying purpose of the patriots who wrote a federal constitution to create a national government
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0069.wav|with national power, intended as they said, "to form a more perfect union
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0070.wav|for ourselves and our posterity.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0071.wav|For nearly twenty years there was no conflict between the Congress and the Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0072.wav|Congress passed a statute which, in eighteen oh three, the Court said violated an express provision of the Constitution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0074.wav|But a little later the Court itself admitted
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0076.wav|It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0079.wav|But since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0080.wav|the Court has more and more often and more and more boldly
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0083.wav|The Court has been acting not as a judicial body, but as a policy-making body.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0084.wav|When the Congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture, to improve the conditions of labor,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0086.wav|to protect our national resources, and in many other ways, to serve our clearly national needs,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0087.wav|the majority of the Court has been assuming the power to pass on the wisdom of these acts of the Congress
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0089.wav|That is not only my accusation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0090.wav|It is the accusation of most distinguished justices of the present Supreme Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0092.wav|But in the case holding the Railroad Retirement Act unconstitutional, for instance,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0093.wav|Chief Justice Hughes said in a dissenting opinion that the majority opinion was "a departure from sound principles,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0095.wav|And three other justices agreed with him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0097.wav|Justice Stone said of the majority opinion that it was a "tortured construction of the Constitution."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0104.wav|And two other justices agreed with him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0108.wav|We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0109.wav|The Court in addition to the proper use of its judicial functions has improperly set itself up as a third house of the Congress
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0112.wav|We have, therefore,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0113.wav|reached the point as a nation where we must take action to save the Constitution from the Court and the Court from itself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0122.wav|It was said in last year's Democratic platform,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0125.wav|adequately to regulate commerce, protect public health and safety, and safeguard economic security.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0130.wav|was to infuse new blood into all our courts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0133.wav|judges who will retain in the courts the judicial functions of a court,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0139.wav|In the case of Supreme Court justices, that pension is twenty thousand dollars a year.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0001.wav|The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, by Franklin D Roosevelt
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0003.wav|What is my proposal?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0004.wav|It is simply this: whenever a judge or justice of any federal court
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0005.wav|has reached the age of seventy and does not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0007.wav|with the approval, as required by the Constitution, of the Senate of the United States.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0011.wav|secondly, to bring to the decision of social and economic problems younger men who have had personal experience and contact
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0013.wav|This plan will save our national Constitution from hardening of the judicial arteries.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0015.wav|or those who would subsequently reach the age of seventy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0018.wav|Consequently, although there never can be more than fifteen, there may be only fourteen, or thirteen, or twelve.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0019.wav|And there may be only nine.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0020.wav|There is nothing novel or radical about this idea.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0021.wav|It seeks to maintain the federal bench in full vigor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0025.wav|Because the laws of many states, the practice of the Civil Service, the regulations of the Army and Navy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0029.wav|There is general approval so far as the lower federal courts are concerned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0036.wav|If by that phrase "packing the Court" it is charged that I wish to place on the bench spineless puppets
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0037.wav|who would disregard the law and would decide specific cases as I wished them to be decided, I make this answer:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0040.wav|But if by that phrase the charge is made
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0043.wav|that I will appoint justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the Congress on legislative policy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0046.wav|then I say that I and with me the vast majority of the American people favor doing just that thing -- now.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0051.wav|I suggest only the addition of justices to the bench
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0052.wav|in accordance with a clearly defined principle relating to a clearly defined age limit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0054.wav|democracy will have failed far beyond the importance to it of any king of precedent concerning the judiciary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0055.wav|We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0056.wav|that we encourage the retirement of elderly judges by offering them a life pension at full salary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0057.wav|Why then should we leave the fulfillment of this public policy to chance
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0059.wav|It is the clear intention of our public policy to provide for a constant flow of new and younger blood into the judiciary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0060.wav|Normally every President appoints a large number of district and circuit court judges and a few members of the Supreme Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0061.wav|Until my first term practically every President of the United States has appointed at least one member of the Supreme Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0062.wav|President Taft appointed five members and named a Chief Justice;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0064.wav|President Hoover, three, including a Chief Justice.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0066.wav|But chance and the disinclination of individuals to leave the Supreme bench
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0067.wav|have now given us a Court in which five justices will be over seventy-five years of age before next June
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0068.wav|and one over seventy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0073.wav|In this way I propose to enforce a sound public policy by law
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0078.wav|Like all lawyers, like all Americans, I regret the necessity of this controversy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0083.wav|This plan of mine is no attack on the Court;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0084.wav|it seeks to restore the Court to its rightful and historic place in our constitutional government
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0087.wav|I have thus explained to you the reasons that lie behind our efforts to secure results by legislation within the Constitution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0088.wav|I hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment may be rendered unnecessary. But,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0090.wav|There are many types of amendment proposed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0093.wav|It would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0095.wav|Then would come the long course of ratification by three-fourths of all the states.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0097.wav|has ever been ratified within anything like a reasonable time.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0100.wav|A very large percentage of newspaper publishers, Chambers of Commerce,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0101.wav|Bar Association, Manufacturers' Associations, who are trying to give the impression that they really do want a constitutional amendment
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0103.wav|Oh! I was for an amendment all right, but this amendment you proposed is not the kind of amendment that I was thinking about.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0107.wav|The first includes those who fundamentally object to social and economic legislation along modern lines.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0110.wav|And the strategy of that last stand is to suggest the time-consuming process of amendment in order to kill off by delay
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0111.wav|the legislation demanded by the mandate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0112.wav|To them I say: I do not think you will be able long to fool the American people as to your purposes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0113.wav|The other groups is composed of those who honestly believe the amendment process is the best
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0121.wav|Even if an amendment were passed, and even if in the years to come it were to be ratified,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0123.wav|An amendment, like the rest of the Constitution,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0125.wav|This proposal of mine will not infringe in the slightest upon the civil or religious liberties so dear to every American.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0128.wav|The present attempt by those opposed to progress to play upon the fears of danger to personal liberty
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0130.wav|to frighten the workers of America in a pay-envelope propaganda against the Social Security Law.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0131.wav|The workers were not fooled by that propaganda then. The people of America will not be fooled by such propaganda now.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0134.wav|Second, because it will provide a reinvigorated
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0137.wav|and unwilling to assert legislative powers by writing into it their own political and economic policies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0138.wav|During the past half century the balance of power between the three great branches of the federal government,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0141.wav|You who know me will accept my solemn assurance that in a world in which democracy is under attack,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0142.wav|I seek to make American democracy succeed.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0008.wav|This is true only as a matter of detail,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0009.wav|for in the past fifty years it has been made evident that in general principles all living things are fundamentally similar.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0010.wav|One of the most important summaries of this similarity
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0011.wav|is Huxley's famous essay, "The Border Territory Between the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms," written in eighteen seventy-six,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0012.wav|extracts from which follow.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0015.wav|in which the question is treated with that comprehensiveness of knowledge and clear critical judgment which characterize his writings
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0016.wav|and justify biologists in regarding them as representative expressions of the most extensive, if not the profoundest, knowledge of his time.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0017.wav|He affirms that living beings have been subdivided from the earliest times into animated beings, which possess sense and motion,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0020.wav|although the parts of some plants exhibit oscillating movements without any perceptible cause and the leaves of others retract when touched,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0023.wav|reduces the necessity of the existence in them of an alimentary cavity, or reservoir of food,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0024.wav|whence their nutrition may be drawn by vessels, which are a sort of internal roots; and, in the presence of this alimentary cavity
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0025.wav|he naturally sees the primary and the most important distinction between animals and plants,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0028.wav|before it can be converted into substances fitted for absorption,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0030.wav|As the animal body required to be independent of heat and of the atmosphere,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0039.wav|he afterward affirms that nitrogen is peculiar to animals, and herein he places the third distinction between the animal and the plant.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0040.wav|The soil and the atmosphere supply plants with water composed of hydrogen and oxygen
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0041.wav|and carbonic acid containing carbon and oxygen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0046.wav|The relations of plants and animals to the atmosphere are therefore inverse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0048.wav|Respiration -- that is, the absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of carbonic acid
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0049.wav|is the specially animal function of animals and constitutes their fourth distinctive character.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0050.wav|Thus wrote Cuvier in eighteen twenty-eight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0051.wav|But in the fourth and fifth decades of this century
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0052.wav|the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science has ever undergone was effected by the application of the modern microscope
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0053.wav|to the investigation of organic structure,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0054.wav|by the introduction of exact and easily manageable methods of conducting the chemical analysis of organic compounds and finally
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0055.wav|by the employment of instruments of precision for the measurement of the physical forces which are at work in the living economy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0058.wav|but the fact, important as it was, fell into oblivion and had to be rediscovered by Treviranus in eighteen oh seven.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0060.wav|and now such movements of the living substance of plants are well known to be some of the most widely prevalent phenomena of vegetable life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0062.wav|under particular circumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water-weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0064.wav|which, from their similarity to animals of simple organization, were called "zoospores."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0065.wav|Even as late as eighteen forty-five, however, a botanist of Schleiden's eminence dealt very skeptically with these statements,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0066.wav|and his skepticism was the more justified since Ehrenberg in his elaborate and comprehensive work on the infusoria,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0067.wav|had declared the greater number of what are now recognized as locomotive plants to be animals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0069.wav|innumerable plants and free plant cells are known to pass the whole or part of their lives in an actively locomotive condition,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0059.wav|For this purpose the food is taken not into the body proper, but into a kind of tubular chemical laboratory; called the alimentary canal,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0060.wav|through which it slowly passes, being subjected meanwhile to the action of certain chemical substances or reagents, known as digestive ferments.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0061.wav|These substances, which are dissolved in a watery liquid to form the digestive fluid, are secreted by the walls of the alimentary tube.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0063.wav|The food supply of the higher plant, like that of the animal, is the source of the required matter and energy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0066.wav|both from the soil through the roots (liquids) and from the atmosphere through the leaves (gases).
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0067.wav|We have here the direct absorption into the body proper of food-stuffs precisely as the animal takes in water and oxygen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0069.wav|as the potential energy of foodstuffs, but comes in principally as the kinetic energy of sunlight absorbed in the leaves.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0076.wav|The green plant owes its power of absorbing the energy of sunlight
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0080.wav|often in the form of granules embedded in the chlorophyll bodies and free oxygen, most of which is returned to the atmosphere.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0082.wav|Carbon dioxide and water contain no potential energy, since the affinities of their constituent elements are completely satisfied.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0085.wav|And this is due to the fact that in the manufacture of starch in the chlorophyll bodies
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0086.wav|the kinetic energy of sunlight was expended in lifting the atoms into position of vantage, thus endowing them with energy of position.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0089.wav|poor in energy or devoid of it, and out of them to manufacture food -- i.e. complex compounds rich in available potential energy.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0093.wav|The plant absorbs also a small amount of kinetic energy, independently of the sunlight, in the form of heat.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0095.wav|Food (starch) thus produced in the green leaves of higher plants and the inorganic foods
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0096.wav|water, nitrites or nitrates and various mineral substances in solution in water
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0102.wav|but root pressure due to osmosis, capillary action and evaporation from the leaves are factors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0103.wav|Just as the solid food of animals must be digested in preparation for absorption,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0106.wav|The change is from starch to a sugar capable of diffusion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0107.wav|Dissolved in water, the sugar is transported down delicate tubes, chiefly in the growing bark region of the stem.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0108.wav|It is clear that there are upward and downward currents of water containing food (comparable to blood of an animal),
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0111.wav|In the cells the foods undergo metabolic changes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0113.wav|Only proteid foods form new protoplasm

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0119.wav|They may be stored, especially as fat, until needed for oxidation to supply energy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0121.wav|The destruction of protoplasm, excess proteids or the fat and carbohydrate foods is catabolism, destructive metabolism.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0122.wav|Catabolism is probably due to enzyme action, but the final result is chiefly carbon dioxide and water,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0124.wav|In the plant, starch, as has been seen, is first formed in the chlorophyll-bodies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0126.wav|as a preliminary to the real processes of nutrition.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0127.wav|These processes must take place everywhere in ordinary protoplasm,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0132.wav|after absorption into the cells the elements of the starch (or glucose) are, by the living protoplasm, in some unknown way
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0138.wav|Apparently when this reserve supply is finally needed at any point in the plant, it is again changed to glucose and transported thither.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0139.wav|It is probable that new leaves and new tissues generally are always formed in part from this reserve starch.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0142.wav|It is also clear that catabolism or oxidation for the liberation of energy occurs as in animals, but this process is slower.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0144.wav|In both plants and animals simple waste substances result from the catabolic processes in the cells.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0149.wav|excretions which are lost by osmosis through the roots and the accumulated but useless mineral substances which are eliminated by leaf fall.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0151.wav|Hence oxygen must be supplied to the cells.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0155.wav|and later is absorbed from the blood and lymph by all the living cells.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0156.wav|In the plant also oxygen is absorbed through the epidermis and stomata from the air.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0157.wav|This process is, however, obscured during the day because of the oxygen freed in the manufacture of starch which goes on at that time.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0158.wav|Probably this freed oxygen is used for the purpose of oxygenation, but more is freed in the photosynthetic process than is needed for oxygenation
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0159.wav|and hence the excess oxygen is eliminated while starch manufacture is in process.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0160.wav|In comparing a higher animal and a green plant confusion must be avoided regarding the part played by oxygen and carbon dioxide in true respiration

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0055.wav|Dr. Perry noted the President's back brace as he felt for a femoral pulse, which he did not find.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0057.wav|While Dr. Perry was performing the tracheotomy, Drs. Carrico and Ronald Jones made cutdowns on the President's right leg and left arm, respectively,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0092.wav|Did you ever have occasion to look at the President's back?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0095.wav|Before this was accomplished the President's cardiac activity had ceased and closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible to inspect his back.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0097.wav|Question: And why was no effort made at that time to inspect his back? Answer:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0098.wav|I suppose nobody really had the heart to do it.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0150.wav|In the opinion of these experts, it was not possible to estimate the time which elapsed between the placing of the print on the rifle and the date of the lift.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0152.wav|Oswald's palmprint on the underside of the barrel demonstrates that he handled the rifle when it was disassembled.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0153.wav|A palmprint could not be placed on this portion of the rifle, when assembled, because the wooden foregrip covers the barrel at this point.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0154.wav|The print is additional proof that the rifle was in Oswald's possession.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0161.wav|This shirt was also composed of dark blue, gray- black and orange-yellow cotton fibers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0162.wav|Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0163.wav|Stombaugh explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as distinct from fingerprint or firearms identification,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0168.wav|There is no way, however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers having come from another identical shirt, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0170.wav|the Commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft on the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by Oswald when he was arrested,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0171.wav|and that this was the same shirt which Oswald wore on the morning of the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0172.wav|Marina Oswald testified that she thought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0173.wav|The testimony of those who saw him after the assassination was inconclusive about the color of Oswald's shirt,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0178.wav|the evidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he was wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0183.wav|The relative freshness of the fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle on the morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0185.wav|Moreover, the Commission found no reliable evidence that Oswald used the rifle at any time between September twenty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0186.wav|when it was transported from New Orleans, and November twenty-two, the day of the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0188.wav|provides some evidence that they were placed on the rifle that day
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0189.wav|since there was limited, if any, opportunity for Oswald to handle the weapon during the two months prior to November twenty-two.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0192.wav|The rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped in a blanket for about eight weeks prior to November twenty-two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0194.wav|the Commission was unable to reach any firm conclusion as to when the fibers were caught in the rifle.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0195.wav|The Commission was able to conclude, however, that the fibers most probably came from Oswald's shirt.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0198.wav|During the period from March two, nineteen sixty-three, to April twenty-four, nineteen sixty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0199.wav|the Oswalds lived on Neely Street in Dallas in a rented house which had a small back yard.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0200.wav|One Sunday, while his wife was hanging diapers, Oswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle, a pistol
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0201.wav|and issues of two newspapers later identified as the Worker and the Militant.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0203.wav|on November twenty-two, nineteen sixty-three. One of these pictures, Exhibit Number one thirty-three A, shows most of the rifle's configuration.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0206.wav|After comparing the rifle in the simulated photograph with the rifle in Exhibit Number one thirty-three A, Shaneyfelt testified, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0209.wav|He stated, however, that while he, quote, found no differences, end quote, between the rifles in the two photographs, he could not make a, quote, positive identification

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0213.wav|The negative of that picture, Commission Exhibit Number one thirty-three B, was found among Oswald's possessions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0216.wav|He concluded that the negative of Exhibit Number one thirty-three B was exposed in Oswald's Imperial Reflex camera to the exclusion of all other cameras.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0219.wav|They are photographs of the same scene.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0221.wav|it is reasonably certain that Exhibit Number one thirty-three A was taken by the same camera at the same time, as Marina Oswald testified.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0222.wav|Moreover, Shaneyfelt testified that in his opinion the photographs were not composites of two different photographs
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0224.wav|One of the photographs taken by Marina Oswald was widely published in newspapers and magazines,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0225.wav|and in many instances the details of these pictures differed from the original, and even from each other, particularly as to the configuration of the rifle.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0229.wav|This information enabled the Commission to conclude
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0230.wav|that the published pictures were the same as the original except for retouching done by these publications, apparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines of the rifle
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0232.wav|The dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the purchase of the rifle
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0233.wav|reinforce the belief that the rifle in the photograph is the rifle which Oswald bought from Klein's.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0235.wav|From an examination of one of the photographs, the Commission determined the dates of the issues of the Militant and the Worker which Oswald was holding in his hand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0236.wav|By checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time it usually takes to effect delivery to Dallas,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0240.wav|By Sunday, March thirty-one, nineteen sixty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0241.wav|ten days prior to the Walker attempt, Oswald had undoubtedly received the rifle shipped from Chicago on March twenty,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0242.wav|the revolver shipped from Los Angeles on the same date, and the two newspapers which he was holding in the picture.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0249.wav|that Oswald may have sat on the screened-in porch at night practicing with the rifle by looking through the telescopic sight and operating the bolt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0252.wav|Marina Oswald has stated that the rifle was among these possessions, although Ruth Paine testified that she was not aware of it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0253.wav|From September twenty-four, nineteen sixty-three, when Marina Oswald arrived in Irving from New Orleans, until the morning of the assassination,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0254.wav|the rifle was, according to the evidence, stored in a green and brown blanket in the Paines' garage among the Oswalds' other possessions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0257.wav|When she started to open the blanket, she saw the stock of the rifle.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0260.wav|He thought it contained tent poles, or possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0261.wav|When he appeared before the Commission, Michael Paine lifted the blanket
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0262.wav|with the rifle wrapped inside and testified that it appeared to be the same approximate weight and shape as the package in his garage.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0265.wav|Each man testified that he thought he could detect the outline of a rifle in the blanket, even though the blanket was empty.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0267.wav|examined the blanket and discovered a bulge approximately ten inches long midway in the blanket.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0268.wav|This bulge was apparently caused by a hard protruding object which had stretched the blanket's fibers.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0023.wav|Frazier, surprised, asked him why he was going to Irving on Thursday night rather than Friday.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0025.wav|The two men left work at four:forty p.m. and drove to Irving.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0027.wav|Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, Frazier's sister, commented to her brother about Oswald's unusual midweek return to Irving.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0028.wav|Frazier told her that Oswald had come home to get curtain rods.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0029.wav|It would appear, however, that obtaining curtain rods was not the purpose of Oswald's trip to Irving on November twenty-one.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0032.wav|In the Paines' garage, along with many other objects of a household character,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0033.wav|there were two flat lightweight curtain rods belonging to Ruth Paine but they were still there on Friday afternoon after Oswald's arrest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0034.wav|Oswald never asked Mrs. Paine about the use of curtain rods,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0035.wav|and Marina Oswald testified that Oswald did not say anything about curtain rods on the day before the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0037.wav|In deciding whether Oswald carried a rifle to work in a long paper bag on November twenty-two,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0044.wav|In the garage were the personal belongings of the Oswald family including, as the evidence has shown, the rifle wrapped in the old brown and green blanket.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0048.wav|Mrs. Paine was certain that she had not left the light on in the garage after dinner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0049.wav|According to Mrs. Paine, Oswald had gone to bed by nine p.m.;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0053.wav|Only if disassembled could the rifle fit into the paper bag found near the window from which the shots were fired.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0054.wav|A firearms expert with the FBI assembled the rifle in six minutes using a ten-cent coin as a tool,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0056.wav|While the rifle may have already been disassembled when Oswald arrived home on Thursday, he had ample time that evening to disassemble the rifle
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0057.wav|and insert it into the paper bag.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0059.wav|A short time later Mrs. Paine told her that someone had shot the President, quote, from the building in which Lee is working, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0060.wav|Marina Oswald testified that at that time, quote, My heart dropped.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0061.wav|I then went to the garage to see whether the rifle was there and I saw that the blanket was still there and I said Thank God, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0062.wav|She did not unroll the blanket. She saw that it was in its usual position and it appeared to her to have something inside.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0063.wav|Soon afterward, at about three p.m., police officers arrived and searched the house.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0068.wav|Mrs. Paine testified, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0069.wav|As she [Marina] told me about it I stepped onto the blanket roll
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0073.wav|Mrs. Paine had the actual blanket before her as she testified and she indicated that the blanket hung limp in the officer's hand.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0082.wav|He carried a, quote, heavy brown bag, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0083.wav|Oswald gripped the bag in his right hand near the top, quote, It tapered like this as he hugged it in his hand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0084.wav|It was more bulky toward the bottom, end quote, than toward the top.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0085.wav|She then opened the kitchen door and saw Oswald open the right rear door of her brother's car and place the package in the back of the car.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0086.wav|Mrs. Randle estimated that the package was approximately twenty-eight inches long and about eight inches wide.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0088.wav|Frazier met Oswald at the kitchen door and together they walked to the car.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0089.wav|After entering the car, Frazier glanced over his shoulder and noticed a brown paper package on the back seat.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0090.wav|He asked, quote, What's the package, Lee? End quote. Oswald replied, quote, curtain rods, end quote.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0094.wav|As they sat in the car, Frazier asked Oswald where his lunch was, and Oswald replied that he was going to buy his lunch that day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0095.wav|Frazier testified that Oswald carried no lunch bag that day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0100.wav|Frazier recalled that one end of the package was under Oswald's armpit and the lower part was held with his right hand
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0103.wav|It was the first time that Oswald had not walked with Frazier from the parking lot to the building entrance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0107.wav|No other employee has been found who saw Oswald enter that morning.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0108.wav|In deciding whether Oswald carried the assassination weapon in the bag which Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0110.wav|Frazier and Mrs. Randle testified
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0115.wav|I remember that I didn't look at the package very much but when I did look at it he did have his hands on the package like that, end quote, and at this point
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0116.wav|Frazier placed the upper part of the package under his armpit and attempted to cup his right hand beneath the bottom of the bag.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0117.wav|The disassembled rifle was too long to be carried in this manner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0119.wav|Moreover, in an interview on December one, nineteen sixty-three, with agents of the FBI, Frazier had marked the point on the back seat of his car
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0120.wav|which he believed was where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge against the door.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0121.wav|The distance between the point on the seat and the door was twenty-seven inches.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0123.wav|that the bag she saw Oswald carrying, quote, wasn't that long, I mean it was folded down at the top as I told you. It definitely wasn't that long, end quote,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0126.wav|that the width was approximately the same.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0127.wav|The Commission has weighed the visual recollection of Frazier and Mrs. Randle against the evidence here presented

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0130.wav|and her first remembrance is that it was held in Oswald's right hand, quote, and it almost touched the ground as he carried it, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0131.wav|Frazier's view of the bag was from the rear. He continually advised that he was not paying close attention. For example, he said, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0132.wav|I didn't pay too much attention the way he was walking because I was walking along there looking at the railroad cars and watching the men on the diesel switch them cars

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0134.wav|Frazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald held the bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end tucked into his armpit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0136.wav|A handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape was found in the southeast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from which the shots were fired.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0140.wav|Three cartons had been placed at the window apparently to act as a gun rest and a fourth carton was placed behind those at the window.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0192.wav|When Paul M. Stombaugh of the FBI Laboratory examined the paper bag,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0194.wav|The blanket in which the rifle was stored was composed of brown and green cotton, viscose and woolen fibers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0199.wav|because other types of fibers present in the blanket were not found in the bag.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0201.wav|All I would say here is that it is possible that these fibers could have come from this blanket.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0205.wav|then I would say the possibility exists, these fibers could have come from this blanket, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0206.wav|Stombaugh confirmed that the rifle could have picked up fibers from the blanket and transferred them to the paper bag.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0207.wav|In light of the other evidence linking Lee Harvey Oswald, the blanket, and the rifle to the paper bag found on the sixth floor,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0209.wav|The preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald (one)

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0014.wav|These two small cartons had been moved from a stack about three aisles away.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0015.wav|The boxes in the window appeared to have been arranged as a convenient gun rest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0016.wav|Behind these boxes was another carton placed on the floor on which a man sitting
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0017.wav|could look southwesterly down Elm Street over the top of the "Rolling Readers" cartons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0019.wav|on which appeared the print of the left index finger and right palm of Lee Harvey Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0020.wav|The cartons were forwarded to the FBI in Washington.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0021.wav|Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent Fingerprint Section,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0022.wav|testified that twenty identifiable fingerprints and eight palmprints were developed on these cartons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0023.wav|The carton on the windowsill and the large carton below the window contained no prints which could be identified as being those of Lee Harvey Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0028.wav|The "Rolling Readers" cartons, however, had not been moved by the floor layers and had apparently been taken to the window from their regular position for some particular purpose.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0030.wav|They could be easily adjusted and were still solid enough to serve as a gun rest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0032.wav|had been one of these moved by the floor layers from the west wall to near the east side of the building in preparation for the laying of the floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0033.wav|During the afternoon of November twenty-two,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0034.wav|Lieutenant Day of the Dallas police dusted this carton with powder and developed a palmprint on the top edge of the carton on the side nearest the window.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0035.wav|The position of this palmprint on the carton was parallel with the long axis of the box, and at right angles with the short axis;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0037.wav|Someone sitting on the box facing the window would have his palm in this position if he placed his hand alongside his right hip.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0039.wav|In Latona's opinion, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0040.wav|not too long, end quote, a time had elapsed between the time that the print was placed on the carton and the time that it had been developed by the Dallas police.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0041.wav|Although Bureau experiments had shown that twenty-four hours was a likely maximum time, Latona stated
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0042.wav|that he could only testify with certainty that the print was less than three days old.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0045.wav|Since cartons absorb perspiration, powder can successfully develop a print on such material only within a limited time.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0046.wav|When the FBI in Washington received the cartons, the remaining prints, including Oswald's on the Rolling Readers carton,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0047.wav|were developed by chemical processes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0049.wav|so no conclusions can be drawn as to whether these remaining prints preceded or followed the print developed in Dallas by powder.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0053.wav|reached the same conclusion as Latona that the prints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0054.wav|In addition, Mandella was of the opinion that the print taken from the carton on the floor
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0055.wav|was probably made within a day or a day and a half of the examination on November twenty-two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0057.wav|In evaluating the significance of these fingerprint and palmprint identifications,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0058.wav|the Commission considered the possibility that Oswald handled these cartons as part of his normal duties.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0060.wav|who, like Oswald, might have handled the cartons. They were also compared with the prints of those law enforcement officials who might have handled the cartons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0062.wav|Although a person could handle a carton and not leave identifiable prints,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0063.wav|none of these employees except Oswald left identifiable prints on the cartons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0066.wav|that Oswald was at the window from which the shots were fired, although the prints do not establish the exact time he was there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0072.wav|The employees raced the elevators to the first floor. Givens saw Oswald standing at the gate on the fifth floor as the elevator went by.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0074.wav|I discovered I left my cigarettes in my jacket pocket upstairs, and I took the elevator back upstairs to get my jacket with my cigarettes in it, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0075.wav|He saw Oswald, a clipboard in hand, walking from the southeast corner of the sixth floor toward the elevator.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0076.wav|Givens said to Oswald, quote, Boy are you going downstairs? It's near lunch time, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0077.wav|Oswald said, quote, No, sir. When you get downstairs, close the gate to the elevator, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0078.wav|Oswald was referring to the west elevator which operates by pushbutton and only with the gate closed. Givens said, "Okay,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0079.wav|and rode down in the east elevator.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0081.wav|Givens thought this was about eleven:fifty-five a.m.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0085.wav|found a clipboard hidden by book cartons in the northwest corner of the sixth floor at the west wall a few feet from where the rifle had been found.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0086.wav|This clipboard had been made by Kaiser and had his name on it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0087.wav|Kaiser identified it as the clipboard which Oswald had appropriated from him when Oswald came to work at the Depository.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0088.wav|Three invoices on this clipboard, each dated November twenty-two, were for Scott-Foresman books, located on the first and sixth floors.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0092.wav|in reaching the conclusion that the shots came from the sixth floor, southeast corner window of the Depository Building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0095.wav|When the shots were fired, Brennan was in an excellent position to observe anyone in the window. He was sitting on a concrete wall
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0097.wav|The window was approximately one hundred twenty feet away.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0099.wav|After hearing the first shot, which he thought was a motorcycle backfire, Brennan glanced up at the window. He testified that, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0100.wav|this man I saw previously was aiming for his last shot. As it appeared to me he was standing up and resting against the left window sill, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0102.wav|Within minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man to the police.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0103.wav|This description most probably led to the radio alert sent to police cars at approximately twelve:forty-five p.m., which described the suspect as white,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0104.wav|slender, weighing about one sixty-five pounds, about five foot ten inches tall, and in his early thirties.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0115.wav|of the man who shot Patrolman J. D. Tippit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0118.wav|that the description of the suspect in the Tippit shooting was similar to the description which had been given by Brennan in connection with the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0122.wav|As will be discussed fully below, the Commission has concluded that this suspect was Lee Harvey Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0124.wav|The half-open window, the arrangement of the boxes, and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing position.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0125.wav|It is understandable, however, for Brennan to have believed that the man with the rifle was standing. A photograph of the building taken seconds after the assassination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0127.wav|Brennan testified that they were standing, which is their apparent position in the photograph.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0130.wav|Since the window ledges in the Depository Building are lower than in most buildings,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0131.wav|a person squatting or kneeling exposes more of his body than would normally be the case.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0132.wav|From the street, this creates the impression that the person is standing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0133.wav|Brennan could have seen enough of the body of a kneeling or squatting person to estimate his height.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0134.wav|Shortly after the assassination Brennan noticed
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0137.wav|The two men, Harold Norman and James Jarman, Jr., each confirmed that when they came out of the building,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0141.wav|and he said that the shots came from inside the building, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0142.wav|During the evening of November twenty-two, Brennan identified Oswald as the person in the lineup who bore the closest resemblance to the man in the window
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0144.wav|Prior to the lineup,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0147.wav|Brennan stated that he was sure that the person firing the rifle was Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0150.wav|but, in his testimony before the Commission, Brennan stated that his remarks of January seven were intended by him merely as an accurate report
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0151.wav|of what he said on November twenty-two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0154.wav|and I felt like there hadn't been more than one eyewitness, and if it got to be a known fact that I was an eyewitness, my family or I, either one, might not be safe.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0160.wav|on Brennan's subsequent certain identification of Lee Harvey Oswald as the man he saw fire the rifle.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0161.wav|Immediately after the assassination, however,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0162.wav|Brennan described to the police the man he saw in the window and then identified Oswald as the person who most nearly resembled the man he saw.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0163.wav|The Commission is satisfied that, at the least,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0164.wav|Brennan saw a man in the window who closely resembled Lee Harvey Oswald, and that Brennan believes the man he saw was in fact
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0167.wav|of the sixth floor approximately one minute before the assassination, although neither witness saw the shots being fired.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0172.wav|Fischer looked up and watched the man in the window for ten or fifteen seconds and then started watching the motorcade, which came into view on Houston Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0173.wav|He said that the man held his attention until the motorcade came because the man, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0174.wav|appeared uncomfortable for one, and secondly, he wasn't watching. he didn't look like he was watching for the parade.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0175.wav|He looked like he was looking down toward the Trinity River and the Triple Underpass down at the end -- toward the end of Elm Street. And
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0177.wav|Fischer placed the man in the easternmost window on the south side of the Depository Building on either the fifth or the sixth floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0178.wav|He said that he could see the man from the middle of his chest to the top of his head, and that as he was facing the window the man was in the lower right-hand portion of the window
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0179.wav|and, quote, seemed to be sitting a little forward, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0182.wav|The person in the window was a white man and, quote, looked to me like he was looking straight at the Triple Underpass, end quote, down Elm Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0184.wav|Approximately one week after the assassination, according to Fisher, policemen showed him a picture of Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0188.wav|On November twenty-two, Fischer had apparently described the man as, quote, light-headed, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0189.wav|Fischer explained that he did not mean by the earlier statement that the man was blond, but rather that his hair was not black.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0193.wav|Fischer and Edwards did not see the man clearly enough or long enough to identify him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0194.wav|Their testimony is of probative value, however, because their limited description is consistent with that of the man who has been found by the Commission,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0198.wav|Euins, who was on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets testified that he could not describe the man he saw in the window.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0199.wav|According to Euins, however, as the man lowered his head in order to aim the rifle down Elm Street, he appeared to have a white bald spot, on his head.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0201.wav|but a radio reporter testified that Euins described the man to him as, quote, colored, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0202.wav|In his Commission testimony
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0203.wav|Euins stated that he could not ascertain the man's race and that the statement in the affidavit was intended to refer only to the white spot on the man's head
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0206.wav|confirmed that Euins could neither describe the man in the window nor indicate his race.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0207.wav|Accordingly, Euins' testimony is considered probative as to the source of the shots but is inconclusive as to the identity of the man in the window.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0213.wav|Just before snapping the picture Altgens heard a noise which sounded like the popping of a firecracker.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0013.wav|Having recently heard the sounds of rifles while on a hunting trip, Baker recognized the shots as that of a high-powered rifle; Quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0017.wav|He heard two more shots spaced, quote, pretty well even to me.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0021.wav|A woman screamed, quote, Oh, they have shot that man, they have shot that man, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0022.wav|Baker, quote, had it in mind that the shots came from the top of this building here, end quote, so he ran straight to the entrance of the Depository Building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0024.wav|and this man, Mr. Truly, spoke up and says, it seems to me like he says,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0025.wav|I am a building manager. Follow me, officer, and I will show you, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0027.wav|They went through the swinging door and continued at, quote, a good trot, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0028.wav|to the northwest corner of the floor where Truly hoped to find one of the two freight elevators.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0034.wav|The stairs from one floor to the next are "L-shaped," with both legs of the "L" approximately the same length.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0035.wav|Because the stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see anything on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at the top of the stairs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0037.wav|This door leads into a small vestibule, and another door leads from the vestibule into the second-floor lunchroom.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0038.wav|The lunchroom door is usually open, but the first door is kept shut by a closing mechanism on the door.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0041.wav|but through the window in the door he caught a fleeting glimpse of a man walking in the vestibule toward the lunchroom.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0042.wav|Since the vestibule door is only a few feet from the lunchroom door, the man must have entered the vestibule only a second or two before Baker arrived at the top of the stairwell.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0044.wav|If the man had passed from the vestibule into the lunchroom, Baker could not have seen him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0045.wav|Baker said, quote, He [Truly] had already started around the bend to come to the next elevator going up,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0050.wav|With his revolver drawn, Baker opened the vestibule door and ran into the vestibule.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0052.wav|Baker stopped at the door of the lunchroom and commanded, quote, Come here, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0053.wav|The man turned and walked back toward Baker.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0055.wav|Along a side wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink rending machine, but at that time the man had nothing in his hands.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0056.wav|Meanwhile, Truly had run up several steps toward the third floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0058.wav|Baker turned to Truly and said, quote, Do you know this man, does he work here? end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0059.wav|Truly replied, "Yes."

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0067.wav|from the sixth floor by the time Baker and Truly arrived, Commission counsel asked Baker and Truly to repeat their movements from the time of the shot

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0076.wav|Special Agent John Howlett of the Secret Service carried a rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor along the east aisle to the northeast corner.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0078.wav|Then Howlett walked down the stairway to the second-floor landing and entered the lunchroom.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0081.wav|The second test followed immediately after the first.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0084.wav|The minimum time required by Baker to park his motorcycle and reach the second-floor lunchroom was within three seconds of the time needed to walk

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0086.wav|The time actually required for Baker and Truly to reach the second floor on November twenty-two was probably longer than in the test runs. For example,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0087.wav|Baker required fifteen seconds after the simulated shot to ride his motorcycle one hundred eighty to two hundred feet,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0088.wav|park it, and run forty-five feet to the building.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0093.wav|On the basis of this time test, therefore,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0098.wav|he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same shaft, were on the fifth floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0099.wav|Baker, not realizing that there were two elevators, thought that only one elevator was in the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0102.wav|Truly and Baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with Oswald in the lunchroom.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0104.wav|The east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived; the west elevator was not.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0107.wav|testified that he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a noise which sounded like a backfire.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0108.wav|Eddie Piper, the janitor, told Dougherty that the President had been shot,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0112.wav|The west elevator was not on the fifth floor when Baker and Truly reached that floor,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0114.wav|Neither elevator could have been used by Oswald as a means of descent.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0115.wav|Oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0116.wav|Three employees -- James Jarman, Jr.,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0117.wav|Harold Norman, and Bonnie Ray Williams -- were watching the parade from the fifth floor, directly below the window from which the shots were fired.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0119.wav|until after they saw Patrolman Baker's white helmet on the fifth floor moving toward the elevator.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0121.wav|This is the period during which Oswald would have descended the stairs. In all likelihood
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0122.wav|Dougherty took the elevator down from the fifth floor after Jarman, Norman, and Williams ran to the west windows and were deciding what to do.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0124.wav|Neither Jarman, Norman, Williams, or Dougherty saw Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0125.wav|Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository Building,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0126.wav|claimed that within about one minute following the shots she ran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0127.wav|down the rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two Depository employees -- William Shelley and Billy Lovelady.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0130.wav|Actually she noticed no one on the back stairs. If she descended from the fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0132.wav|When she reached the first floor, she actually saw Shelley and Lovelady slightly east of the east elevator.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0134.wav|that they were watching the parade from the top step of the building entrance when Gloria Calverly, who works in the Depository Building,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0136.wav|Lovelady and Shelley moved out into the street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0137.wav|About this time Shelley saw Truly and Patrolman Baker go into the building
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0138.wav|Shelley and Lovelady, at a fast walk or trot, turned west into the railroad yards and then to the west side of the Depository Building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0139.wav|They reentered the building by the rear door several minutes after Baker and Truly rushed through the front entrance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0141.wav|If Miss Adams accurately recalled meeting Shelley and Lovelady when she reached the bottom of the stairs,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0142.wav|then her estimate of the time when she descended from the fourth floor is incorrect,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0143.wav|and she actually came down the stairs several minutes after Oswald and after Truly and Baker as well.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0144.wav|Oswald's departure from building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0145.wav|Within a minute after Baker and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0147.wav|Mrs. Reid had watched the parade from the sidewalk in front of the building with Truly and Mr. O. V. Campbell, vice president of the Depository.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0153.wav|As Oswald passed Mrs. Reid she said, quote, Oh, the President has been shot, but maybe they didn't hit him, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0159.wav|Mrs. Reid believes that she returned to her desk from the street about two minutes after the shooting.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0160.wav|Reconstructing her movements, Mrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in two minutes by stopwatch.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0166.wav|While it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed off the building,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0168.wav|One of the police officers assigned to the corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the Presidential motorcade, W. E. Barnett,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0174.wav|where upon Barnett posted himself at the front door to make certain that no one left the building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0175.wav|The sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0176.wav|Barnett estimated that approximately three minutes elapsed between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time he started guarding the front door.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0180.wav|that a witness (Amos Euins) had seen shots fired from a window of the building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0181.wav|At that time, Inspector Herbert V. Sawyer's car was parked in front of the building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0182.wav|Harkness did not know whether or not two officers with Sawyer were guarding the doors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0184.wav|He then entered the building and took the front passenger elevator as far as it would go -- the fourth floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0186.wav|After he returned to the street he directed Sergeant Harkness to station two patrolmen at the front door and not let anyone in or out;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0187.wav|he also directed that the back door be sealed off.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0188.wav|This was no earlier than twelve:thirty-seven p.m. and may have been later.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0189.wav|Special Agent Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service, who had been in the motorcade,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0192.wav|Although Oswald probably left the building at about twelve:thirty-three p.m., his absence was not noticed until at least one-half hour later.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0193.wav|Truly, who had returned with Patrolman Baker from the roof, saw the police questioning the warehouse employees.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0194.wav|Approximately fifteen men worked in the warehouse and Truly noticed that Oswald was not among those being questioned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0195.wav|Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing, Truly obtained Oswald's address, phone number, and description from his employment application card.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0198.wav|Truly estimated that he gave this information to Fritz about fifteen or twenty minutes after the shots,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0199.wav|but it was probably no earlier than one:twenty-two p.m., the time when the rifle was found.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0200.wav|Fritz believed that he learned of Oswald's absence after the rifle was found.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0201.wav|The fact that Truly found Fritz in the northwest corner of the floor, near the point where the rifle was found, supports Fritz' recollection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0202.wav|Fingerprint and palmprint evidence establishes that Oswald handled two of the four cartons next to the window
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0205.wav|and no one could be found who saw Oswald anywhere else in the building until after the shooting.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0206.wav|An eyewitness to the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the window which was similar to Oswald's actual appearance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0207.wav|This witness identified Oswald in a lineup as the man most nearly resembling the man he saw and later identified Oswald as the man he observed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0210.wav|On the basis of these findings the Commission has concluded that Oswald, at the time of the assassination,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0006.wav|At about one:sixteen p.m., a Dallas police officer, J. D. Tippit, was shot less than one mile from Oswald's roominghouse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0008.wav|(one) positive identification of the killer by two eyewitnesses who saw the shooting
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0012.wav|(four) evidence establishing the ownership of a zipper jacket
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0013.wav|found along the path of flight taken by the gunman from the scene of the shooting to the place of arrest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0015.wav|According to the reconstruction of time and events which the Commission found most credible,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0019.wav|When Oswald was apprehended, a bus transfer marked for the Lakewood-Marsalis route was found in his shirt pocket.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0020.wav|The transfer was dated "Friday November twenty-two, 'sixty-three" and was punched in two places by the bus driver.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0021.wav|On the basis of this punchmark, which was distinctive to each Dallas driver,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0024.wav|on a trip which passed a check point at St. Paul and Elm Streets at twelve:thirty-six p.m., November twenty-two, nineteen sixty-three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0025.wav|McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0028.wav|McWatters' recollection is that he issued this transfer to a man who entered his bus just beyond Field Street,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0029.wav|where a man beat on the front door of the bus, boarded it and paid his fare.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0033.wav|asked for a transfer and got off at the same place in the middle of the block where the lady did.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0035.wav|The man was on the bus approximately four minutes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0036.wav|At about six:thirty p.m. on the day of the assassination, McWatters viewed four men in a police lineup.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0041.wav|McWatters also remembered that a man received a transfer at Lamar and Elm Streets and that a man in the lineup was about the size of this man.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0042.wav|However, McWatters' recollection alone was too vague to be a basis for placing Oswald on the bus.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0043.wav|Riding on the bus was an elderly woman, Mary Bledsoe, who confirmed the mute evidence of the transfer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0044.wav|Oswald had rented a room from Mrs. Bledsoe about six weeks before, on October seven, but she had asked him to leave at the end of a week.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0048.wav|She boarded the Marsalis bus at St. Paul and Elm Streets to return home. She testified further, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0049.wav|And, after we got past Akard, at Murphy -- I figured it out. Let's see. I don't know for sure.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0050.wav|Oswald got on. He looks like a maniac. His sleeve was out here. His shirt was undone.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0052.wav|he looked so bad in his face, and his face was so distorted. Hole in his sleeve right here.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0053.wav|End quote. As Mrs. Bledsoe said these words, she pointed to her right elbow.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0054.wav|When Oswald was arrested in the Texas Theatre, he was wearing a brown sport shirt with a hole in the right sleeve at the elbow.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0056.wav|Mrs. Bledsoe recalled that Oswald sat halfway to the rear of the bus which moved slowly and intermittently as traffic became heavy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0057.wav|She heard a passing motorist tell the driver that the President had been shot.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0058.wav|People on the bus began talking about it. As the bus neared Lamar Street, Oswald left the bus and disappeared into the crowd.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0059.wav|The Marsalis bus which Oswald boarded traveled a route west on Elm,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0061.wav|A Beckley bus which also served the Oak Cliff area,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0062.wav|followed the same route as the Marsalis bus through downtown Dallas, except that it continued west on Elm,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0064.wav|Marsalis Street is seven blocks from Beckley.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0065.wav|Oswald lived at ten twenty-six North Beckley.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0067.wav|According to McWatters, the Beckley bus was behind the Marsalis bus, but he did not actually see it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0069.wav|Instead of waiting there, Oswald apparently went as far away as he could and boarded the first Oak Cliff bus which came along
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0071.wav|In a reconstruction of this bus trip, agents of the Secret Service and the FBI walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the Depository Building
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0072.wav|to Murphy and Elm three times, averaging six point five minutes for the three trips.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0074.wav|If Oswald left the Depository Building at twelve:thirty-three p.m.,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0080.wav|toward a light-colored Rambler station wagon, which was moving slowly along Elm toward the underpass:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0081.wav|The station wagon stopped to pick up the man and then drove off.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0083.wav|and told Captain Fritz that Oswald was the man he saw.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0085.wav|Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said, quote, Everybody will know who I am now, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0086.wav|The Commission could not accept important elements of Craig's testimony.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0089.wav|Fritz did not bring him into his office to identify Oswald but turned him over to Lieutenant Baker for questioning.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0090.wav|If Craig saw Oswald that afternoon, he saw him through the glass windows of the office.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0093.wav|If Oswald had made such a statement, Captain Fritz and others present would probably have remembered it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0094.wav|Craig may have seen a person enter a white Rambler station wagon fifteen or twenty minutes after the shooting and travel west on Elm Street
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0099.wav|that he recognized Oswald from a newspaper photograph as a man whom he had driven to the Oak Cliff area the day before.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0101.wav|He was taken to the lineup room where, according to Whaley, five young teenagers, all handcuffed together, were displayed with Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0102.wav|He testified that Oswald looked older than the other boys.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0104.wav|Whaley picked Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0106.wav|You could have picked him out without identifying him by just listening to him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0107.wav|because he was bawling out the policeman, telling them it wasn't right to put him in line with these teenagers and all of that
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0110.wav|Whaley believes that Oswald's conduct did not aid him in his identification, quote, because I knew he was the right one as soon as I saw him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0114.wav|Only two of the men in the lineup with Oswald were teenagers: John T. Horn, aged eighteen, was Number one;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0118.wav|When he first testified before the Commission,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0120.wav|unloaded at twelve:fifteen p.m.,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0121.wav|a twelve:fifteen p.m. pickup at Continental to Greyhound, unloaded at twelve:thirty p.m.,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0123.wav|unloaded at five hundred North Beckley at twelve:forty-five p.m.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0126.wav|As he unloaded his Continental bus station passenger in front of Greyhound, he started to get out to buy a package of cigarettes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0127.wav|He saw a man walking south on Lamar from Commerce.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0133.wav|and he opened the door a little bit like he was going to get out and he said, "I will let you have this one," and she says, "No, the driver can call me one."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0134.wav|I asked him where he wanted to go. And he said, "five hundred North Beckley. Well, I started up,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0135.wav|I started to that address, and the police cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere, just a big uproar in that end of town and I said,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0136.wav|What the hell. I wonder what the hell is the uproar?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0137.wav|And he never said anything. So I figured he was one of these people that don't like to talk so I never said any more to him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0138.wav|But when I got pretty close to five hundred block at Neches and North Beckley which is the five hundred block, he said, "This will do fine," and I pulled over to the curb right there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0139.wav|He gave me a dollar bill, the trip was ninety-five cents.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0140.wav|He gave me a dollar bill and didn't say anything, just got out and closed the door and walked around the front of the cab over to the other side of the street
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0141.wav|[east side of the street]. Of course, the traffic was moving through there and I put it in gear and moved on, that is the last I saw of him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0143.wav|He marked what, he thought was the intersection of Neches and Beckley on a map of Dallas with a large "X."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0144.wav|He said, quote, Yes, sir; that is right, because that is the five hundred block of North Beckley, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0146.wav|Neches is within one-half block of the roominghouse at ten twenty-six North Beckley where Oswald was living.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0148.wav|After a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before the Commission, Whaley was interviewed again in Dallas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0150.wav|He directed the driver of the car to a point twenty feet north of the northwest corner of the intersection of Beckley and Neely
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0156.wav|He was in error, however.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0159.wav|On the other hand, Whaley identified Commission Exhibit Number one fifty (the shirt taken from Oswald upon arrest) as the shirt his passenger was wearing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0160.wav|He also stated he saw a silver identification bracelet on his passenger's left wrist.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0161.wav|Oswald was wearing such a bracelet when he was arrested.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0162.wav|On November twenty-two, Oswald told Captain Fritz that he rode a bus to a stop near his home and then walked to his roominghouse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0164.wav|And when interrogated about a cab ride, Oswald also admitted that he left the slow-moving bus and took a cab to his roominghouse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0165.wav|The Greyhound Bus Station at Lamar and Jackson Streets, where Oswald entered Whaley's cab,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0166.wav|is three to four short blocks south of Lamar and Elm. If Oswald left the bus at twelve:forty-four p.m.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0167.wav|and walked directly to the terminal, he would have entered the cab at twelve:forty-seven or twelve:forty-eight p.m.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0172.wav|From the five hundred block of North Beckley, the walk would be a few minutes longer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0173.wav|but in either event he would have been in the roominghouse at about one p.m.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0075.wav|However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham's testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of Tippit.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0139.wav|he subsequently testified before a Commission staff member and, when shown two photographs of Oswald, stated that they were photographs of the man he saw.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0141.wav|When Oswald was arrested, he had in his possession a Smith and Wesson thirty-eight Special caliber revolver,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0143.wav|Two of the arresting officers placed their initials on the weapon and a third inscribed his name.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0145.wav|Four cartridge cases were found in the shrubbery on the corner of tenth and Patton by three of the eyewitnesses -- Domingo Benavides,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0150.wav|that he compared the four empty cartridge cases found near the scene of the shooting with a test cartridge fired from the weapon in Oswald's possession when he was arrested.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0156.wav|also examined the four cartridge cases found near the site of the homicide and compared them with the test cartridge cases fired from the Smith and Wesson revolver
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0157.wav|taken from Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0158.wav|He concluded that all of these cartridges were fired from the same weapon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0159.wav|Cunningham compared four lead bullets recovered from the body of Patrolman Tippit with test bullets fired from Oswald's revolver.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0163.wav|Cunningham testified that all of the bullets were mutilated, one being useless for comparison purposes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0165.wav|with five lands and grooves and a right twist which were the rifling characteristics of the revolver taken from Oswald.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0170.wav|But he agreed that because the other three bullets were mutilated, he could not determine if they had been fired from the same weapon as the test bullets.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0171.wav|The examination and testimony of the experts enabled the Commission to conclude that five shots may have been fired,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0172.wav|even though only four bullets were recovered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0173.wav|Three of the bullets recovered from Tippit's body were manufactured by Winchester-Western, and the fourth bullet by Remington-Peters,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0176.wav|And though only one bullet of Remington-Peters manufacture was recovered, two empty cartridge cases of that make were retrieved.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0216.wav|It should be noted, however, that the President's car was curving slightly to the right when the third shot was fired.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0228.wav|Concerning the shots which struck the President in the back of the neck,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0229.wav|Sergeant Zahm testified, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0230.wav|With the equipment he [Oswald] had and with his ability I consider it a very easy shot, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0232.wav|the assassin was then required to hit the target one more time within a space of from four point eight to five point six seconds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0233.wav|On the basis of Oswald's training and the accuracy of the weapon as established by the tests,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0235.wav|The probability of hitting the President a second time would have been markedly increased if, in fact, he had missed either the first or third shots

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0006.wav|The Commission has considered many possible motives for the assassination, including those which might flow from Oswald's commitment to Marxism or communism,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0007.wav|the existence of some personal grievance,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0009.wav|None of these possibilities satisfactorily explains Oswald's act if it is judged by the standards of reasonable men.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0010.wav|The motives of any man, however, must be analyzed in terms of the character and state of mind of the particular individual involved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0013.wav|Oswald's complete state of mind and character are now outside of the power of man to know.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0014.wav|He cannot, of course, be questioned or observed by those charged with the responsibility for this report or by experts on their behalf.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0016.wav|and in the history of his life which does give some insight into his character and, possibly, into the motives for his act.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0018.wav|the Commission is not able to reach any definite conclusions as to whether or not he was, quote, sane, unquote, under prevailing legal standards.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0019.wav|Under our system of justice no forum could properly make that determination unless Oswald were before it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0020.wav|It certainly could not be made by this Commission which, as has been pointed out above,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0021.wav|ascertained the facts surrounding the assassination but did not draw conclusions concerning Oswald's legal guilt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0024.wav|Perhaps the most outstanding conclusion of such a study is that Oswald was profoundly alienated from the world in which he lived.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0025.wav|His life was characterized by isolation, frustration, and failure.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0026.wav|He had very few, if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to have great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0028.wav|When he was in the United States he resented the capitalist system which he thought was exploiting him and others like him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0029.wav|He seemed to prefer the Soviet Union and he spoke highly of Cuba.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0031.wav|who were accorded special privileges and who he thought were betraying communism, and he spoke well of the United States.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0035.wav|While Oswald appeared to most of those who knew him as a meek and harmless person, he sometimes imagined himself as, quote, the Commander, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0036.wav|and, apparently seriously, as a political prophet -- a man who said that after twenty years he would be prime minister.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0037.wav|His wife testified that he compared himself with great readers of history.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0039.wav|He had a great hostility toward his environment, whatever it happened to be,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0041.wav|There was some quality about him that led him to act with an apparent disregard for possible consequences.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0042.wav|He defected to the Soviet Union, shot at General Walker, tried to go to Cuba and even contemplated hijacking an airplane to get there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0043.wav|He assassinated the President, shot Officer Tippit, resisted arrest and tried to kill another policeman in the process.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0047.wav|That associate did not think that Oswald was a Communist.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0049.wav|He stated several times that he was a Communist but apparently never joined any Communist Party.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0052.wav|that his commitment to Marxism was an important factor influencing his conduct during his adult years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0053.wav|It was an obvious element in his decision to go to Russia and later to Cuba and it probably influenced his decision to shoot at General Walker.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0055.wav|The discussion below will describe the events known to the Commission which most clearly reveals the formation and nature of Oswald's character.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0060.wav|and his unsuccessful attempt to go to Cuba in late September of nineteen sixty-three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0065.wav|That death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder of the Oswald family.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0076.wav|In the fall of that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0077.wav|where they stayed, except for vacations, until the spring of nineteen forty-eight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0079.wav|John Pic testified that he thought Lee found in Ekdahl the father that he never had.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0081.wav|for the relations between Marguerite Oswald and Ekdahl were stormy and they were finally divorced, after several separations and reunions,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0085.wav|John Pic, however, did not think her position was worse than that of many other people.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0089.wav|In order to supplement their income further she falsely swore that Pic was seventeen years old so that he could join the Marine Corps Reserves.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0091.wav|but he returned to high school in January of nineteen forty-nine, where he stayed until three days before he was scheduled to graduate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0092.wav|when he left school in order to get into the Coast Guard. Since his mother did not approve of his decision to continue school
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0093.wav|he accepted the responsibility for that decision himself and signed his mother's name to all his own excuses and report cards.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0094.wav|Pic thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and was unduly concerned about money.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0096.wav|Pic said, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0097.wav|Lee was brought up in this atmosphere of constant money problems, and I am sure it had quite an effect on him, and also Robert, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0103.wav|An indication of the nature of Lee's character at this time was provided in the spring of nineteen fifty,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0107.wav|but apparently was not able to spend as much time with them as he would have liked, because of the age gaps of five and seven years,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0108.wav|which became more significant as the children grew older.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0110.wav|he apparently adjusted well enough there to have had an average, although gradually deteriorating, school record
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0111.wav|with no behavior or truancy problems.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0112.wav|That was not the case, however, after he and his mother moved to New York in August of nineteen fifty-two, shortly before Lee's thirteenth birthday.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0113.wav|They moved shortly after Robert joined the Marines; they lived for a time with John Pic who was stationed there with the Coast Guard.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0117.wav|The short-lived stay with the Pics was terminated after an incident in which Lee allegedly pulled out a pocket knife during an argument

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0161.wav|Dr. Hartogs recommended that Oswald be placed on probation on condition that he seek help and guidance through a child guidance clinic.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0162.wav|There, he suggested, Lee should be treated by a male psychiatrist who could substitute for the lack of a father figure.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0174.wav|Lee confirmed some of those observations by saying that he felt almost as if there were a veil between him and other people

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0238.wav|Such a placement was postponed, however, perhaps in part at least because Lee's behavior suddenly improved.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0011.wav|Several witnesses testified that Lee Oswald was not aggressive. He was, however, involved in some fights.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0014.wav|Two days later, quote, some big guy, probably from a high school -- he looked like a tremendous football player, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0015.wav|accosted Oswald on the way home from school and punched him in the mouth, making his lip bleed and loosening a tooth.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0016.wav|Voebel took Oswald back to the school to attend to his wounds, and their, quote, mild friendship, end quote, stemmed from that incident.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0018.wav|but he was not sure then that Oswald meant to carry out the plan, and in fact they never did.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0019.wav|Voebel said that Oswald, quote, wouldn't start any fights, but if you wanted to start one with him, he was going to make sure that he ended it,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0020.wav|or you were going to really have one, because he wasn't going to take anything from anybody, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0022.wav|Oswald first wrote, quote, Edward Vogel, end quote, an obvious misspelling of Voebel's name,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0030.wav|One of his fellow employees, Palmer McBride, stated that Oswald said he would like to kill President Eisenhower because he was exploiting the working class.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0031.wav|Oswald praised Khrushchev and suggested that he and McBride join the Communist Party, quote, to take advantage of their social functions, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0032.wav|Oswald also became interested in the New Orleans Amateur Astronomy Association, an organization of high school students.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0038.wav|heard what we were arguing on communism, and that this boy was loud-mouthed, boisterous, and my father asked him to leave the house and politely put him out of the house,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0039.wav|and that is the last I have seen or spoken with Oswald. End quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0040.wav|Despite this apparent interest in communism, Oswald tried to join the Marines when he was sixteen years old.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0041.wav|This was one year before his actual enlistment and just a little over two point five years after he left New York.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0043.wav|In fact, he had quit school in an attempt to obtain his mother's assistance to join the Marines.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0046.wav|There is evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0047.wav|approximately three years before. Robert Oswald had given his Marine Corps manual to his brother Lee,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0048.wav|who studied it during the year following his unsuccessful attempt to enlist until, quote, He knew it by heart, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0052.wav|Oswald's inability or lack of desire to enter into meaningful relationships with other people
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0053.wav|continued during this period in New Orleans (nineteen fifty-four to nineteen fifty-six).
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0054.wav|It probably contributed greatly to the general dissatisfaction which he exhibited with his environment,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0055.wav|a dissatisfaction which seemed to find expression at this particular point
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0056.wav|in his intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his surroundings and his mother.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0058.wav|which might appear to be inconsistent with his desire to join the Marines, could have been another manifestation of Oswald's rejection of his environment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0060.wav|Kerry Thornley, a marine associate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0062.wav|testified that, quote, definitely the Marine Corps was not what he had expected it to be when he joined, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0065.wav|testified that Oswald seemed, quote, always to be striving for a relationship, but whenever he did
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0068.wav|While there is nothing in Oswald's military records to indicate that he was mentally unstable or otherwise psychologically unfit for duty in the Marine Corps,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0069.wav|he did not adjust well to conditions which he found in that service.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0070.wav|He did not rise above the rank of private first class, even though he had passed a qualifying examination for the rank of corporal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0072.wav|that he was a man of great ability and intelligence and that many of his superiors in the Marine Corps were not sufficiently competent to give him orders.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0073.wav|While Oswald did not seem to object to authority in the abstract, he did think that he should be the one to exercise it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0075.wav|that authority, particularly the Marine Corps, ought to be able to recognize talent such as his own, without a given magic college degree,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0078.wav|When the officers were unable to discuss foreign affairs satisfactorily with him, Oswald regarded them as unfit to exercise command over him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0080.wav|in those arguments, quote, and make himself come out top dog, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0083.wav|Thornley also testified that he thought that Oswald's extreme personal sloppiness in the Marine Corps, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0084.wav|fitted into a general personality pattern of his: to do whatever was not wanted of him, a recalcitrant trend in his personality, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0086.wav|and then used the, quote, special treatment, end quote, he received as an example of the way in which he was being picked on and, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0087.wav|as a means of getting or attempting to get sympathy, end quote. In Thornley's view, Oswald labored under a persecution complex
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0092.wav|an, quote, individual that you would brainwash, and quite easy, but I think once he believed in something, he stood in his beliefs, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0094.wav|He had the nickname, quote, Ozzie Rabbit, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0096.wav|Normally, it would be a good type of literature; and the one that I recall was "Leaves of Grass," by Walt Whitman, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0097.wav|According to Powers, Oswald said, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0099.wav|Powers believed that when Oswald arrived in Japan he acquired a girlfriend, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0100.wav|finally attaining a male status or image in his own eyes, end quote. That apparently caused Oswald to become more self-confident,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0103.wav|Oswald once told Powers that he didn't care if he returned to the United States at all.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0104.wav|While in Japan, Oswald's new found apparent self confidence and pugnaciousness
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0105.wav|led to an incident in which he spilled a drink on one of his sergeants and abusively challenged him to fight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0107.wav|He testified that he had felt the sergeant had a grudge against him and that he had unsuccessfully sought a transfer from the sergeant's unit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0108.wav|He said that he had simply wanted to discuss the question with the sergeant and the drink had been spilled accidentally.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0109.wav|The hearing officer agreed with the latter claim but found Oswald guilty of wrongfully using provoking words and sentenced him to twenty-eight days,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0111.wav|for possessing an unauthorized pistol with which he had accidentally shot himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0112.wav|At his own request,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0113.wav|Oswald was transferred from active duty to the Marine Corps Reserve under honorable conditions in September of nineteen fifty-nine,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0115.wav|He was undesirably discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve, to which he had been assigned on inactive status following his transfer from active duty,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0118.wav|Oswald wrote to then Secretary of the Navy Connally on January thirty, nineteen sixty-two,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0120.wav|Governor Connally had just resigned to run for Governor of Texas, so he advised Oswald that he had forwarded the letter to his successor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0121.wav|It is thus clear that Oswald knew that Governor Connally was never directly concerned with his discharge
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0123.wav|In that connection, it does not appear that Oswald ever expressed any dissatisfaction of any kind with either the President or Governor Connally.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0126.wav|But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. Lee said that when he would return to the United States he would vote for him for Governor, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0128.wav|Even though Oswald apparently did not express any hostility against the President or Governor Connally,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0129.wav|he continued to be concerned about his undesirable discharge. It is clear that he thought he had been unjustly treated.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0130.wav|Probably his complaint was due to the fact that his discharge was not related to anything he had done while on active duty
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0132.wav|He continued his efforts to reverse the discharge by petitioning the Navy Discharge Review Board,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0133.wav|which finally declined to modify the discharge and so advised him in a letter dated July nineteen sixty-three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0135.wav|In that connection, it should be noted that Marina Oswald testified on September six, nineteen sixty-four, that she thought her husband, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0142.wav|Once it had started down Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, however,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0149.wav|He told Aline Mosby, a reporter who interviewed him after he arrived in Moscow, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0151.wav|An old lady handed me a pamphlet about saving the Rosenbergs. I looked at that paper and I still remember it for some reason, I don't know why. End quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0156.wav|he preferred the, quote, Red Army, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0158.wav|Thornley, who thought Oswald had an "irrevocable conviction" that his Marxist beliefs were correct, testified, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0159.wav|I think you could sit down and argue with him for a number of years, and I don't think you could have changed his mind on that unless you knew why he believed it in the first place.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0160.wav|I certainly don't. I don't think with any kind of formal argument you could have shaken that conviction. And that is why I say irrevocable.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0161.wav|It was just -- never getting back to looking at things from any other way once he had become a Marxist, whenever that was, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0166.wav|in honor of some retiring noncommissioned officers, an event which they both approached with little enthusiasm.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0169.wav|and on how angry it made him, to which Thornley replied, quote, Well, comes the revolution you will change all that, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0173.wav|Thornley said that he had made his remark only in the context of "nineteen eighty-four"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0177.wav|and expressed opposition to the Batista regime and sympathy for Castro, an attitude which, Donovan said, was, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0178.wav|not unpopular, end quote, at that time. Donovan testified
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0179.wav|that he never heard Oswald express a desire personally to take part in the elimination of injustices anywhere in the world and that he, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0180.wav|never heard him in any way, shape or form confess that he was a Communist, or that he ever thought about being a Communist, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0182.wav|and believed that our Government did not have, quote, too much to offer, end quote, but was not in favor of, quote, the Communist way of life, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0185.wav|Thornley also believed that Oswald's Marxist beliefs led to an extraordinary view of history under which, quote, He looked upon the eyes of future people
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0186.wav|as some kind of tribunal,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0187.wav|and he wanted to be on the winning side so that ten thousand years from-now people would look in the history books and say, "Well, this man was ahead of his time."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0188.wav|The eyes of the future became the eyes of God.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0189.wav|He was concerned with his image in history and I do think that is why he chose the particular method of defecting he chose and did it in the way he did.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0191.wav|Thornley thought that Oswald not only wanted a place in history but also wanted to live comfortably in the present.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0192.wav|He testified that if Oswald could not have that, quote, degree of physical comfort that he expected or sought,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0193.wav|I think he would then throw himself entirely on the other thing he also wanted, which was the image in history.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0195.wav|Oswald's interest in Marxism led some people to avoid him,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0196.wav|even though as his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention. He used his Marxist and associated activities
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0199.wav|is shown most clearly by his employment relations after his return from the Soviet Union. Of course, he made his real problems worse to the extent

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0005.wav|After Oswald left the Marine Corps in September of nineteen fifty-nine, ostensibly to care for his mother,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0007.wav|At the age of nineteen, Oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking indication he had yet given
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0010.wav|it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0012.wav|who had arranged a radio debate on Oswald's activities on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0013.wav|that while he had begun to read Marx and Engels at the age of fifteen, the conclusive thing that made him decide that Marxism was the answer
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0015.wav|He said living conditions over there convinced him something was wrong with the system, and that possibly Marxism was the answer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0017.wav|and see for himself how a revolutionary society operates, a Marxist society.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0020.wav|indicating that his motivation was at least in part a personal one. On November twenty-six, nineteen fifty-nine,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0021.wav|shortly after he arrived in the Soviet Union, and probably before Soviet authorities had given him permission to stay indefinitely,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0023.wav|and that he went there, quote, only to find freedom. I could never have been personally happy in the U.S., end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0025.wav|His idea that he was to find, quote, freedom, end quote, in the Soviet Union was to be rudely shattered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0026.wav|Whatever Oswald's reasons for going to the Soviet Union might have been, however, there can be little doubt that his desire to go was quite strong.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0028.wav|Oswald had managed to save enough money to cover the expenses of his forthcoming trip.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0029.wav|While there is no proof that he saved fifteen hundred dollars, as he claimed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0032.wav|and of his initial commitment to that country can best be understood, however, in the context

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0092.wav|The interesting thing, or rather the danger involved, was the fact that Oswald seemed like such a nice, bright boy

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0134.wav|His brief foray on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee had failed to win any support.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0135.wav|While he had drawn some attention to himself and had actually appeared on two radio programs, he had been attacked by Cuban exiles and arrested,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0160.wav|he may not have intended to go to the Soviet Union directly, if at all. It appears that he really wanted to go to Cuba.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0162.wav|I only know that his basic desire was to get to Cuba by any means, and that all the rest of it was window dressing for that purpose. End quote.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0192.wav|and as far as the performance of the Cubans themselves was concerned, he was, quote, disappointed at not being able to get to Cuba

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0164.wav|He said that he was tired of living alone and perhaps the reason for my being so angry was the fact that we were not living together.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0186.wav|He must have planned his attack at the very latest prior to Thursday morning when he spoke to Frazier.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0187.wav|There is, of course, no way to determine the degree to which he was committed to his plan at that time.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0205.wav|After he returned from his trip to Mexico where his application to go to Cuba had been sharply rejected,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0207.wav|He could not keep them with him in Dallas, where at least he could see his children whom, several witnesses testified, he seemed to love.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0208.wav|His family lived with Mrs. Paine, ostensibly because Oswald could not afford to keep an apartment in Dallas,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0209.wav|but it was also, at least in part, because his wife did not want to live there with him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0210.wav|Now it appeared that he was not welcome at the Paine home,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0211.wav|where he had spent every previous weekend since his return from Mexico and his wife was once again calling into question his judgment,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0216.wav|nineteen sixty-three, merely to disarm her and to provide a justification of sorts,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0218.wav|Thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly on his mind when he went to Irving on Thursday night and told his wife that he was lonely,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0219.wav|that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his family to Dallas where they could live with him again.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0220.wav|The Commission does not believe that the relations between Oswald and his wife caused him to assassinate the President.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0225.wav|Oswald's behavior after the assassination throws little light on his motives.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0233.wav|He consistently refused to admit involvement in the assassination or in the killing of Patrolman Tippit.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0245.wav|Oswald's search for what he conceived to be the perfect society was doomed from the start.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0246.wav|He sought for himself a place in history -- a role as the "great man" who would be recognized as having been in advance of his times.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0147.wav|The Commission believes
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0148.wav|that a more formal statement of assigned responsibilities, supplemented in each case to reflect the peculiar conditions of each Presidential trip
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0149.wav|is essential. This would help to eliminate varying interpretations of Secret Service instructions by different local law enforcement representatives. For example,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0150.wav|while the Secret Service representatives in Dallas
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0151.wav|asked the police to station guards at each overpass to keep, quote, unauthorized personnel, end quote, off, this term was not defined.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0152.wav|At some overpasses all persons were excluded
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0155.wav|Assistant Chief Batchelor of the Dallas police noted the absence of any formal statement by the Secret Service of specific work assigned to the police
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0157.wav|Agent Lawson agreed that such a procedure would assist him and other agents in fulfilling their responsibilities as advance agents.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0159.wav|Agent Lawson did not arrange for a prior inspection of buildings along the motorcade route,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0160.wav|either by police or by custodians of the buildings, since it was not the usual practice of the Secret Service to do so.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0166.wav|But on out-of-town trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0168.wav|With the number of men available to the Secret Service and the time available, surveys of hundreds of buildings and thousands of windows is not practical.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0170.wav|While certain streets thought to be too narrow could be avoided and other choices made,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0174.wav|Similar arrangements for a motorcade of ten miles, including many blocks of tall commercial buildings is not practical.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0175.wav|Nor is it practical to prevent people from entering such buildings, or to limit access in every building to those employed or having business there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0176.wav|Even if it were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so, many observers have felt
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0180.wav|This justification of the Secret Service's standing policy is not persuasive.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0182.wav|President Kennedy himself had mentioned it that morning, as had Agent Sorrels when he and Agent Lawson were fixing the motorcade route.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0183.wav|Admittedly, protective measures cannot ordinarily be taken with regard to all buildings along a motorcade route.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0185.wav|An attempt to cover only the most obvious points of possible ambush along the route in Dallas might well have included the Texas School Book Depository Building.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0186.wav|Instead of such advance precautions, the Secret Service depended in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along the route.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0187.wav|In addition, Secret Service agents riding in the motorcade were trained to scan buildings as part of their general observation of the crowd of spectators.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0190.wav|If such instructions were in fact given, they were not effectively carried out.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0201.wav|I stressed the fact that this was our President and he should be shown every respect due his position and that it was our duty to see that this was done.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0205.wav|They had, however, occasionally observed the windows of buildings in the area before the motorcade arrived, in accordance with their own understanding of their function.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0206.wav|As the motorcade approached Elm Street
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0208.wav|Agent Sorrels, riding in the lead car, did observe the Texas School Book Depository Building as he passed by,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0210.wav|He was handicapped, however, by the fact that he was riding in a closed car whose roof at times obscured his view.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0211.wav|Lawson, also in the lead car, did not scan any buildings since an important part of his job was to look backward at the President's car.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0213.wav|watching his car, watching the sides, watching the crowds, giving advice or asking advice from the Chief
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0216.wav|stated that he scanned the Depository Building, but not sufficiently to be alerted by anything in the windows or on the roof.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0217.wav|The agents in the follow-up car also were expected to scan adjacent buildings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0218.wav|However, the Commission does not believe that agents stationed in a car behind the Presidential car,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0219.wav|who must concentrate primarily on the possibility of threats from crowds along the route, provide a significant safeguard against dangers in nearby buildings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0222.wav|in Fort Worth, there occurred a breach of discipline by some members of the Secret Service who were officially traveling with the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0223.wav|After the President had retired at his hotel,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0224.wav|nine agents who were off duty went to the nearby Fort Worth Press Club at midnight or slightly thereafter, expecting to obtain food;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0225.wav|they had little opportunity to eat during the day. No food was available at the Press Club.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0229.wav|The statements of the agents involved are supported by statements of members of the Fort Worth press who accompanied or observed them
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0231.wav|According to their statements, the agents remained at the Press Club for periods varying from thirty minutes to an hour and a half,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0232.wav|and the last agent left the Press Club by two a.m.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0233.wav|Two of the nine agents returned to their rooms. The seven others proceeded to an establishment called the Cellar Coffee House,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0236.wav|There is no indication that any of the agents who visited the Cellar Coffee House had any intoxicating drink at that establishment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0237.wav|Most of the agents were there from about one:thirty or one:forty-five a.m. to about two:forty-five or three a.m.;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0243.wav|Only one stayed as long as a half hour, and none had any beverage there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0244.wav|Chief Rowley testified that agents on duty in such a situation usually stay within the building during their relief,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0253.wav|The supervisor of each of the off-duty agents who visited the Press Club or the Cellar Coffee House
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0254.wav|advised, in the course of the Secret Service investigation of these events, that each agent reported for duty on time,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0255.wav|with full possession of his mental and physical capabilities and entirely ready for the performance of his assigned duties. Chief Rowley testified that,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0257.wav|and that their conduct the night before did not impede their actions on duty
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0259.wav|However, Chief Rowley did not condone the action of the off-duty agents, particularly since it violated a regulation of the Secret Service,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0042.wav|At that time the agents on the framing boards of the follow-up car were expected to perform such a function.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0062.wav|Their primary responsibility is to stay with and protect the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0063.wav|Beyond these two principles the Secret Service believes a detailed contingency or emergency plan is not feasible
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0066.wav|For instance, the lead car always is manned by Secret Service agents familiar with the area and with local law enforcement officials;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0067.wav|the radio net in use in motorcades is elaborate and permits a number of different means of communication with various local points.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0070.wav|Any effort to prepare detailed contingency plans might well have the undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0072.wav|those in command should be able to direct the response appropriate to the emergency. The Commission finds that the Secret Service agents in the motorcade
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0074.wav|Their actions demonstrate that the President and the Nation can expect courage and devotion to duty from the agents of the Secret Service.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0078.wav|have properly taken the initiative in reexamining major aspects of Presidential protection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0081.wav|There was no Federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination of President Kennedy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0082.wav|Had there been reason to believe that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy, Federal jurisdiction could have been asserted;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0084.wav|Murder of the President has never been covered by Federal law, however, so that once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a single person,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0085.wav|the State of Texas had exclusive jurisdiction.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0086.wav|It is anomalous that Congress has legislated in other ways touching upon the safety of the Chief Executive or other Federal officers,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0087.wav|without making an attack on the President a crime. Threatening harm to the President is a Federal offense,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0089.wav|The murder of Federal judges, U.S. attorneys and marshals, and a number of other specifically designated
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0090.wav|Federal law enforcement officers is a Federal crime.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0092.wav|without authorizing it to arrest anyone who harms him. The same provisions authorize the Service to arrest without warrant
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0093.wav|persons committing certain offenses, including counterfeiting and certain frauds involving Federal checks or securities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0094.wav|The Commission agrees with the Secret Service that it should be authorized to make arrests without warrant
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0096.wav|There have been a number of efforts to make assassination a Federal crime, particularly after the assassination of President McKinley

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0155.wav|while investigating a plot to assassinate President Cleveland, the Service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the White House.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0157.wav|and special details protected him in Washington, on trips, and at special functions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0158.wav|These informal and part-time arrangements led to more systematic protection in nineteen oh two, after the assassination of President McKinley;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0168.wav|As discussed above, the Bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its Handbook
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0174.wav|to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0176.wav|On the other hand, the Secret Service had no knowledge whatever of Oswald, his background, or his employment at the Book Depository,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0177.wav|and Robert I. Bouck, who was in charge of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service, believed that the accumulation of the facts known to the FBI
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0178.wav|should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the Secret Service of the Oswald risk.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0179.wav|The Commission believes that both the FBI and the Secret Service have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0182.wav|In addition, the Commission has concluded that the Secret Service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0187.wav|These proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0188.wav|in one or another Government agency, to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved, and to retain the existing system
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0189.wav|but expand both the scope and the operations of the existing agencies, particularly those of the Secret Service and the FBI.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0190.wav|It has been pointed out that the FBI, as our chief investigative agency,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0196.wav|On the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection of the President and his family should be committed to an elite and independent corps.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0197.wav|It is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the Presidential family
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0198.wav|in all its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall it,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0199.wav|and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance of their tremendous responsibility.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0201.wav|and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0202.wav|incident to its responsibilities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0206.wav|and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto, it seems clear
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0213.wav|There are always dangers of divided responsibility,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0214.wav|duplication, and confusion of authority where more than one agency is operating in the same field; but on the other hand

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0219.wav|These considerations have induced the Commission to believe
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0220.wav|that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the Executive and the Congress,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0227.wav|Without, therefore, coming to final conclusions respecting the long-range organization of the President's security,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0228.wav|the Commission believes that the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy point to certain measures which,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0007.wav|have made it difficult for the Treasury to maintain close and continuing supervision.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0010.wav|Daily supervision of the operations of the Secret Service within the Department of the Treasury should be improved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0012.wav|through an Assistant Secretary whose duties also include the direct supervision of the Bureau of the Mint

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0015.wav|The Commission recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special assistant with the responsibility of supervising the Service.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0016.wav|This special assistant should be required to have sufficient stature and experience in law enforcement, intelligence, or allied fields
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0017.wav|to be able to provide effective continuing supervision
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0018.wav|and to keep the Secretary fully informed regarding all significant developments relating to Presidential protection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0021.wav|Actions by the Service since the assassination indicate its awareness of the necessity for substantial improvement in its administration.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0066.wav|The volume of references to the Secret Service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0067.wav|more than five thousand names were referred to the Secret Service in the first four months of nineteen sixty-four.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0068.wav|According to Chief Rowley, by mid-June nineteen sixty-four,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0075.wav|The Commission shares this concern.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0076.wav|The problem is aggravated by the necessity that the Service obtain the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0077.wav|and in taking preventive steps.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0078.wav|In June nineteen sixty-four, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0083.wav|Information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the President
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0084.wav|or, quote, other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0106.wav|to devise a practical system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such malcontents.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0107.wav|Liaison with other agencies regarding intelligence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0108.wav|The Secret Service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0121.wav|Detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the Secret Service and both of these agencies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0122.wav|It should be made clear that the Secret Service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0129.wav|and this source should not be neglected by undue concentration on relationships with other Federal agencies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0130.wav|Finally, these agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little value
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0133.wav|In his testimony Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon informed the Commission
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0134.wav|that an interagency committee has been established to develop more effective criteria.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0135.wav|According to Secretary Dillon,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0140.wav|Secretary Dillon testified that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that adequate liaison is maintained.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0159.wav|The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0161.wav|The Secret Service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other Federal agencies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0165.wav|the Commission had occasion to become informed, to a limited extent, about the data processing techniques of other Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0166.wav|The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0167.wav|to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0168.wav|with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0169.wav|and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0170.wav|This matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0180.wav|so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Service's field offices.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0181.wav|The Commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0185.wav|The Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0186.wav|in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0187.wav|Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0189.wav|that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0195.wav|Inspection of Buildings
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0197.wav|According to Secretary Dillon,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0198.wav|the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0199.wav|The Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0200.wav|The Secret Service should utilize the personnel of other Federal law enforcement offices
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0202.wav|Lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0208.wav|salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0213.wav|field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the President is traveling.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0215.wav|these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially overworked.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0216.wav|In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July one, nineteen sixty-four,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0218.wav|Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0221.wav|The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0223.wav|The plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0224.wav|one hundred forty-five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0225.wav|and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0226.wav|eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the White House detail
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0230.wav|Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0231.wav|Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0233.wav|Since the assassination, the Service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0234.wav|It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0236.wav|Thus, in the four months following the assassination,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0237.wav|the FBI, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty-nine agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0240.wav|the Service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0241.wav|The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0243.wav|The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0244.wav|the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0246.wav|which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0247.wav|The Commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0248.wav|and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0250.wav|The Secret Service will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0251.wav|the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0252.wav|The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes the reality
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0253.wav|that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0254.wav|The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0257.wav|Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0258.wav|Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0259.wav|some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination, and to a far greater extent thereafter,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0260.wav|the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0262.wav|Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service are adequately augmented,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0263.wav|it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and other agencies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0264.wav|The Commission recommends that the present arrangements
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0265.wav|with the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on a permanent and formal basis.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0266.wav|The exchange of letters dated August thirty-one, nineteen sixty-four,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0268.wav|The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0269.wav|The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0270.wav|This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0271.wav|The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0274.wav|made certain recommendations which it believes would, if adopted,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0277.wav|with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the United States in their demands upon their President,
