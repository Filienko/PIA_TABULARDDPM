datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0112.wav|instead of ending in the sharp and clear stroke of Jenson's letters;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0138.wav|this is the tendency to the formation of ugly meandering white lines or "rivers" in the page

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0203.wav|The new jail had been in a great measure constructed by the prisoners themselves.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0204.wav|Masons, bricklayers, carpenters, painters had been employed upon the buildings, and the work was pronounced excellent by competent judges.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0219.wav|The diet was now ample. It consisted of a pound and a half of bread per diem;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0220.wav|for breakfast a pint of gruel; for dinner half a pound of boiled meat, or a quart of soup with vegetables, on alternate days.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0221.wav|The food was properly prepared in the prison kitchen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0226.wav|It was also claimed for the more ample and more orderly distribution of victuals, that the general health of the prisoners had greatly improved.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0240.wav|He left Newgate utterly corrupted, and after lapsing into crime, soon returned with a very different character.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0241.wav|Other cases of moral deterioration have already been recorded.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0242.wav|Some attempt was made to reduce the overcrowding, on the recommendation of the House of Commons Committee of eighteen eighteen, but this applied only a partial remedy.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0247.wav|thus disposing of the objection so long raised against the industrial employment of prisoners in Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0248.wav|But this boon of toil was denied to all but a very limited number.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0249.wav|As the Prison Discipline Society pertinently observed in a report dated eighteen twenty,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0005.wav|Even then they were not certain of the favor, for I find a reference to a decent and respectable woman sent to Newgate
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0006.wav|who handed a shilling to the escort warder to provide her with a hackney coach; but this functionary pocketed the cash, and obliged the woman to walk

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0021.wav|who, in a caustic article contributed to the 'Edinburgh Review,' protested against the pampering of criminals
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0024.wav|He objected to the instruction of prisoners in reading and writing.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0027.wav|He was altogether against too liberal a diet; he disapproved of industrial occupations in jails, as not calculated to render prisons terrible.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0034.wav|Undeterred by these sarcasms and misrepresentations,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0035.wav|the Society pursued its laudable undertaking with remarkable energy and great singleness of purpose.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0036.wav|The objects it had in view were set forth in one of its earliest meetings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0037.wav|It sought to obtain and diffuse useful information
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0038.wav|to suggest beneficial regulations, and circulate tracts demonstrating the advantages of classification,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0040.wav|It earnestly advocated the appointment of female officers to take exclusive charge of female prisoners,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0223.wav|There was a diminution in the numbers in custody, due to the adoption of the practice of not committing at once to Newgate every offender for trial at the Old Bailey

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0235.wav|Last, and worst of all, the arrangements for keeping the condemned prisoners between sentence and execution were more than unsatisfactory.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0237.wav|so that "corrupt conversation obliterated from the mind of him who is doomed to suffer every serious feeling and valuable impression."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0238.wav|I shall have more to say on this subject, and upon the state of Newgate generally, in the following chapter.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0243.wav|Nevertheless a committee of the House of Commons was appointed in eighteen thirty-one to report upon the whole system of secondary punishments,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0244.wav|which dealt with jails of all classes, as well as transportation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0245.wav|This committee animadverted strongly upon the system in force at the metropolitan jails, and more especially upon the condition of Newgate

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0248.wav|and stated that in his opinion Newgate, as the common jail of Middlesex, was wholly inadequate to the proper confinement of its prisoners.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0260.wav|a theory which did not become a practical fact for forty more years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0261.wav|As a means of securing this uniformity,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0262.wav|it was suggested that the rules framed for prison government should be subjected to the Secretary of State for approval,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0263.wav|and not, as heretofore, to the judges of assize; that, both to check abuses and watch the progress of improvement,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0264.wav|inspectors of prisons should be appointed, who should visit all the prisons from time to time and report to the Secretary of State.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0265.wav|It was recommended that the dietaries should be submitted and approved like the rules; that convicted prisoners should not receive any food but the jail allowance;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0268.wav|should be strictly prohibited, "as a stimulating luxury inconsistent with any notion of strict discipline and the due pressure of just punishment."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0271.wav|As a means of increasing the severity of imprisonment, letters and visits from outside should not be permitted during the first six months of an imprisonment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0274.wav|The committee most of all insisted upon the entire individual separation of prisoners, except during the hours of labor,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0283.wav|and the tendency to crime in offenders not entirely hardened is confirmed by the language, the suggestions, and the example
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0284.wav|of more depraved and systematic criminals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0285.wav|This committee, as well as the one preceding it, also reported in terms of strong reprobation on the small prisons and jails

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0287.wav|The same language was used by the commissioners appointed to inquire into the municipal corporations in eighteen thirty-five,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0288.wav|when speaking more particularly of the borough jails.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0289.wav|In these the commissioners found "additional proof of the evils of continuing the present constitution of the local tribunals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0290.wav|Instances rarely occur in which the borough jails admit of any proper classification of the prisoners.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0291.wav|In some large towns, as at Berwick on Tweed, Southampton, and Southwark, they (the prisons) are in a very discreditable condition.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0297.wav|They therefore recommended that the prisoners should be removed
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0298.wav|to the county jails from such prisons as were past improvement, and that the borough funds should be charged for the accommodation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0299.wav|The whole question was again dealt with in Lord John Russell's bill for the reform of the municipal corporations, and with a more liberal election of town councilors,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0015.wav|one which required discretion, judgment, and knowledge of law, with sufficient insight and experience to discover defects in prison discipline.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0038.wav|"a subject of magnitude and importance sufficient to exclude other jails," they soon narrowed their inquiry still further,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0039.wav|and limited it to Newgate alone. Newgate indeed became the sole theme of their first report.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0041.wav|Changes introduced under pressure had been only skin deep.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0046.wav|There was no longer the faintest possible excuse for overcrowding. The numbers now committed to Newgate had sensibly diminished.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0052.wav|The sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0054.wav|But incredible as it may appear, the authorities of Newgate declined to avail themselves of the advantages offered them,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0055.wav|and when the population fell they shut up one half the jail and crowded up the other.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0057.wav|Not only were the wards thus needlessly crammed, and for no reason but the niggardliness of the corporation which refused a proper supply of bedding
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0060.wav|The classification prescribed by the Jail Act, which laid down that certain prisoners should not intermix, was openly neglected,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0061.wav|and "the greatest contempt shown for the law."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0063.wav|minor offenders charged with small thefts or non-payment of small sums were cheek by jowl with convicts sentenced to long terms of transportation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0067.wav|"Here," say the inspectors, "are herded together the very worst class of prisoners; certainly a more wretched combination of human beings can hardly be imagined.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0069.wav|consign many of the more petty and unpracticed offenders to this place,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0071.wav|No doubt the governor for the time being, Mr. Cope, was in a great measure to blame for all this, and for the want of proper classification.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0072.wav|I shall have occasion to speak again, and more at length, of Mr. Cope's careless and perfunctory discharge

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0084.wav|and so numerous were his opportunities of showing favoritism, that all the prisoners may be said to be in his power.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0086.wav|his place is assigned among the most depraved, the most experienced, and the most incorrigible offenders in the middle yard.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0087.wav|It must be admitted that so far but little effort had been made to counteract the evils of indiscriminate association.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0091.wav|Their treatment was also a matter of chance. They still slept on rope mats on the floor, herded together in companies of four or more to keep one another warm
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0093.wav|So closely did they lie together, that the inspectors at their night visits found it difficult in stepping across the room to avoid treading on them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0097.wav|Water might not be taken into the ward for washing purposes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0098.wav|There was some provision of clothing, but it was quite insufficient, and nothing at all was given if prisoners had enough of their own to cover their nakedness.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0100.wav|many without stockings, and with hardly shoes to their feet;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0101.wav|some, who had the semblance of covering on the upper part of their feet, had no soles to the shoes, and their bare feet were on the ground.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0102.wav|This, too, was in the depth of the winter, and during a most inclement season.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0103.wav|The allowance of food was not illiberal,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0108.wav|He charged a weekly sum as ward dues for the use of knives, forks, and plates
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0109.wav|a perpetuation under another form of the old detestable custom of garnish.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0110.wav|He had power where his exactions were resisted of making the ward most uncomfortable for the defaulter.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0111.wav|He could trump up a false complaint against his fellow-prisoner, and so get him punished;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0112.wav|he might keep him from the fire, or give him his soup or gruel in a pail instead of a basin.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0119.wav|When the wardsman was a man of some education, with some knowledge of legal chicanery gained by personal experience, he might add considerably to his emoluments
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0121.wav|for a petition of from one shilling, half pence to eight shillings, according to its length,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0122.wav|and by these payments a wardsman had been known to amass as much as forty pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0123.wav|The man intrusted with this privilege was often the inner gatesman,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0125.wav|It was not strange that he should sometimes misuse his power, and when prisoners were not to be cajoled into securing his legal services,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0126.wav|had been known to employ threats, declaring that he was often consulted by the governor as to a prisoner's character,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0127.wav|in view of speaking to it at the trial, and he could easily do them a good turn -- or a very bad one.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0128.wav|The brief-drawing gatesman and wardsman at the time of the inspectors' first visit must have been a particularly powerful personage.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0133.wav|The turnkeys complained bitterly that these old prisoners had more power than they themselves.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0134.wav|The governor himself admitted that a prisoner of weak intellect who had been severely beaten and much injured by a wardsman did not dare complain
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0137.wav|They were not obliged to attend chapel, and seldom if ever went; "prisoners," said one of them under examination, "did not like the trouble of going to chapel."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0138.wav|They had a standing bedstead to sleep on, and a good flock mattress; double allowance of provisions, filched from the common stock.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0140.wav|Evidence was given before the inspectors of eight or ten prisoners seen "giddy drunk, not able to sit upon forms."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0141.wav|The female wards-women were also given to intemperance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0142.wav|The matron deposed to having seen the gates-woman "exceedingly drunk," and having been insulted by her.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0143.wav|There was no penalty attached to drunkenness.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0144.wav|A wardsman did not necessarily lose his situation for it. Nor was drink the only creature comfort he might enjoy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0147.wav|it was still freely introduced into the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0148.wav|Probably authority would not have been so recklessly usurped by the wardsmen had not the proper officials too readily surrendered it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0149.wav|The turnkeys left the prisoners very much to themselves, never entering the wards after locking-up time, at dusk, till unlocking next morning,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0158.wav|The act prescribed that he should do both every twenty-four hours, but days passed without his entering the wards.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0161.wav|Again, a turnkey deposed that his chief did not enter the wards more than once a fortnight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0162.wav|But it is only fair to Mr. Cope to state that he himself said he went whenever he could find time
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0163.wav|and that he was constantly engaged attending sessions and going with drafts to the hulks.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0165.wav|sometimes he looked at his bolts and bars, but he never examined the cupboards, coal-boxes, or other possible hiding-places for cards
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0167.wav|He only attended chapel once on Sunday, never on the week-day, and generally devoted the time service was in progress
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0168.wav|to taking the descriptions of newly-arrived prisoners.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0170.wav|and was surprised when the inspectors proved to him that practices of which he was ignorant, and which he admitted that he reprehended, went on without hindrance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0171.wav|He was satisfied to let matters run on as in the old times, he said in his own justification; with him what was, was right,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0173.wav|He kept no daily journal of occurrences, and nothing, however important, was recorded at the time.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0174.wav|The aldermen never called upon him to report, and left him nearly unsupervised and uncontrolled.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0175.wav|In his administration of discipline he was quite uncertain;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0176.wav|the punishments he inflicted were unequal,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0178.wav|and for years, felons who should have been sent beyond the seas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0179.wav|But, indeed, his whole rule was far too mild, and under this mistaken leniency
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0180.wav|the interior of the jail was more like a bear-garden or the noisy purlieus of a public-house than a prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0182.wav|Under the reckless contempt for regulations,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0184.wav|the most hardened and the oldest in vice had the best of it, while the inexperienced beginner went to the wall.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0193.wav|Idle hands and unoccupied brains found in mischief the only means of whiling away the long hours of incarceration.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0198.wav|But this was not the only amusement. Most of the wards took in the daily papers,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0204.wav|In the same way the wardsman laid in his stock to be retailed. Other light literature besides the daily journals were in circulation:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0205.wav|novels, flash songs, play-books, such as "Jane Shore," "Grimm's German Tales," with Cruikshank's illustrations,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0210.wav|Drink, in more or less unlimited quantities, was still to be had.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0211.wav|Spirits certainly were now excluded; but a potman, with full permission of the sheriffs,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0212.wav|brought in beer for sale from a neighboring public-house, and visited all the wards with no other escort than the prisoner gatesman.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0002.wav|Eighteen years had elapsed since the formation of the "Ladies' Association,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0003.wav|and Mrs. Fry with her colleagues still labored assiduously in Newgate, devoting themselves mainly to the female prison,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0004.wav|although their ministrations were occasionally extended to the male side.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0005.wav|The inspectors paid tribute to the excellence of the motives of these philanthropic ladies, and recognized the good they did.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0006.wav|They had introduced "much order and cleanliness,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0007.wav|had provided work for those who had hitherto passed their time in total idleness, and had made the treatment of female transports on the way to New South Wales

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0016.wav|it tended to "dissipate reflection, diminish the gloom of the prison, and mitigate the punishment which the law has sentenced the prisoner to undergo."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0019.wav|Even in the daytime, when supervision was withdrawn, "the language used to be dreadful," says one of the women when under examination;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0020.wav|"swearing and talking of what crimes they had committed, and how they had done it." Another witness declared she had heard the most shocking language in the yard; she said
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0024.wav|who supped royally on the supplies provided from outside, and kept it up till ten or eleven o'clock.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0029.wav|The condition of the capitally-convicted prisoners after sentence was still very disgraceful. The side they occupied, still known as the press-yard,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0035.wav|The better-disposed complained bitterly of what they had to endure;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0036.wav|one man declared that the language of the condemned rooms was disgusting, that he was dying a death every day in being compelled to associate with such characters.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0039.wav|and when the inspectors visited Newgate they found the three certain to die in a day-room by themselves;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0044.wav|The latter, light-hearted and reckless, conducted themselves in the most unseemly fashion, and "with as much indifference as the inmates of the other parts of the prison."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0045.wav|They amused themselves after their own fashion; played all day long at blind-man's-buff and leap-frog, or beat each other with a knotted handkerchief,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0048.wav|so subversive of meditation, so disturbing to the thoughts;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0049.wav|they suffered sickening anxiety, and wished to be locked up alone. This indiscriminate association lasted for months,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0054.wav|There were disputes and quarrels constantly among these doomed men; it was a word and blow, an argument clenched always with a fight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0055.wav|The more peaceably disposed found some occupation in making Newgate tokens,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0057.wav|Turnkeys occasionally visited the press-yard, but its occupants were under little or no control.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0067.wav|stigmatized his often most just strictures on abuses as "a bundle of nonsense," and the aldermen, when he appealed to them for protection and countenance,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0070.wav|and that he had again and again protested against the obstacles thrown in his way, the inspectors "cannot forbear expressing their opinion that he might have shown greater perseverance,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0076.wav|The lax discipline maintained in Newgate was still further deteriorated by the presence of two other classes of prisoners who ought never to have been inmates of such a jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0080.wav|These powers were not invariably put in force, and there were in consequence many unhappy lunatics in Newgate and other jails,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0083.wav|gives a total of thirty-nine lunatics confined in various jails, many of them guilty of murder and other serious crimes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0084.wav|The inspectors in the following year, on examining the facts, found that some of these poor creatures had been in confinement for long periods:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0087.wav|at Appleby for thirteen years, at Anglesea for fifteen years, at Exeter for sixteen years, and at Pembroke
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0091.wav|The lunatic became the sport of the idle and the depraved. His cure was out of the question;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0096.wav|It was high time that the unsatisfactory state of the law as regards the treatment of criminal lunatics should be remedied
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0098.wav|The other inmates of the prison of an exceptional character, and exempted from the regular discipline, such as it was,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0099.wav|were the ten persons committed to Newgate by the House of Commons in eighteen thirty-five.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0100.wav|These were the gentlemen concerned in the bribery case at Ipswich in eighteen thirty-five,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0102.wav|Pilgrim, Bond, and Clamp, had refused to give evidence before the House of Commons' Committee; a Speaker's warrant was issued for their arrest when they absconded.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0104.wav|the parliamentary agents of the members whose election was impugned, were implicated in aiding and abetting the others to abscond, and a Mr. O'Mally,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0106.wav|Pilgrim and Dasent were caught and given into the custody of the sergeant-at-arms, and the rest were either arrested or they surrendered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0107.wav|A resolution at once passed the House without division to commit the whole to Newgate, where they remained for various terms.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0109.wav|O'Mally sent in a medical certificate, declaring that the imprisonment was endangering his life, and after some question he was also released.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0110.wav|The rest were detained for more than a month, it being considered that they were the most guilty, as being either professional agents, who advised the others to abscond,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0111.wav|or witnesses who did not voluntarily come forward when the chance was given them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0114.wav|A certain number, who could afford the high rate of a guinea per diem, fixed by the under sheriff, were lodged in the governor's house,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0115.wav|slept there, and had their meals provided for them from the Sessions House or London Coffee-House.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0116.wav|A few others, who could not afford a payment of more than half a guinea, were permitted to monopolize a part of the prison infirmary,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0117.wav|where the upper ward was exclusively appropriated to their use. They also had their meals sent in, and, with the food, wine almost ad libitum.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0122.wav|Even Mr. Cope admitted that the committal of this class of prisoners to Newgate was most inconvenient,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0123.wav|and the inspectors expressed themselves still more strongly in reprehension of the practice.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0124.wav|The infirmary at this particular period epitomized the condition of the jail at large.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0126.wav|All the evils of indiscriminate association were strongly accentuated by the crowd collected within its narrow limits.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0129.wav|the sane and the insane, the young and the old, the trivial offender and the man about to suffer the extreme penalty of the law,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0130.wav|are all huddled together without discrimination, oversight, or control."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0134.wav|The wards were in some cases spacious, but they were entirely unsuited for separation or the inspection of prisoners.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0136.wav|But there were others remediable under a better system of management.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0138.wav|who constantly breathed an air heavy, and, when the wards were first opened in the morning, particularly offensive.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0140.wav|The primary object of committing a prisoner to jail, as the inspectors pointed out, was to deter not only the criminal himself, but others from crime,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0142.wav|But at Newgate the convicted prisoner, instead of privation and hard fare,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0145.wav|Instead of seclusion and meditation, his time is passed in the midst of a body of criminals of every class and degree, in riot, debauchery, and gaming,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0146.wav|vaunting his own adventures, or listening to those of others;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0149.wav|the jail, and the scaffold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0150.wav|He is allowed intercourse with prostitutes who, in nine cases out of ten, have originally conduced to his ruin;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0153.wav|is generally known to all the worst men in the country; not only without the inclination, but almost without the ability of returning to an honest life."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0154.wav|These pungent and well-grounded strictures applied with still greater force to the unconvicted prisoner, the man who came to the prison innocent, and still uncontaminated,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0157.wav|The evils of such association were aggravated by the unbroken idleness; one "evil inflamed the other;" reformation
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0158.wav|or any kind of moral improvement was impossible; the prisoner's career was inevitably downward, till he struck the lowest depths.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0159.wav|Forced and constant intercourse with the most depraved individuals of his own class;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0166.wav|Strong as were the foregoing remarks, the inspectors wound up their report in still more trenchant language
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0167.wav|framing a terrible indictment against those responsible for the condition of Newgate. Their words deserve to be quoted in full.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0168.wav|"We cannot close these remarks," say the inspectors, "without an expression of the painful feelings with which we submit to your Lordship
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0169.wav|this picture of the existing state of Newgate
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0178.wav|and when the first municipal authority of our land will be no longer subjected to the reproach of fostering an institution which outrages the rights and feelings of humanity,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0184.wav|The inspectors retorted without loss of time, reiterating their charges, and pointing out that the committee of aldermen by its own admission
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0185.wav|justified the original allegations. It was impossible to deny the indiscriminate association; the gambling, drinking, smoking, quarreling in the jail;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0186.wav|the undue authority given to prisoners, the levying of garnish under another name
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0189.wav|The corporation evidently had the worst of it, and began to feel the necessity for undertaking the great work of reform.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0190.wav|Next year we find the inspectors expressing their satisfaction that "the full and faithful exposure which we felt it our duty to make of Newgate
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0191.wav|has been productive of at least some advantage,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0192.wav|inasmuch as it has aroused the attention of those upon whom parliamentary reports and grand jury presentments had hitherto failed to make the slightest impression.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0195.wav|to give better light and ventilation; the construction of bed-places, three tiers high alongside the walls for males, two tiers for females;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0197.wav|The infirmary was enlarged, the admission of visitors limited, and the passing of articles prevented by a wire screen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0202.wav|But the one great and most crying evil remained unremedied.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0209.wav|they return to the charge, and again call the corporation to task for their mismanagement of Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0213.wav|Again the following year the inspectors repeat their charge.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0214.wav|"The prominent evils of this prison (Newgate) -- evils which the alterations made within the last four years have failed to remove
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0215.wav|are the association of prisoners, and the unusual contamination to which such association gives rise.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0216.wav|For nearly twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four the prisoners are locked up, during which time no officer is stationed in the ward with them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0223.wav|The prison officials appear to be on the side of the inspectors, to the great dissatisfaction of the corporation, who claimed the full allegiance and support of its servants.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0226.wav|or the Inspectors of Prisons, and that he be required wholly to confine himself to the performance of his duty as prescribed by Act of Parliament.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0227.wav|The inspectors were not to be deterred, however, by any opposition from the earnest discharge of their functions, and continued to report against Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0235.wav|instead of ventilating the apartments, they only serve to convey the offensive effluvia arising from the decaying animal matter into the dining-rooms.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0237.wav|Many rats also come through these so-called ventilators, as they open close to the ground at the back of the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0238.wav|At the same time the inspectors animadvert strongly upon the misconduct of prisoners and the frequency of prison punishments,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0239.wav|both offenses and punishments affording a sufficient index to the practices going forward; and they wind up by declaring

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0010.wav|at first, and for some few years after seventeen eighty-four, executions took place occasionally at a distance from Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0011.wav|This was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0012.wav|partly perhaps because residents in and about the Old Bailey raised a loud protest against the constant erection of the scaffold in their neighborhood.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0015.wav|was executed on a gibbet in front of his victim's house.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0016.wav|Lawrence Jones, a burglar, was in seventeen ninety-three ordered for execution in Hatton Garden, near the house he had robbed;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0018.wav|extended upon a plank on the top of an open cart, in his clothes, and fettered.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0040.wav|A full description of this new gallows, which was erected in front of the debtors' door, is to be found in contemporary records.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0041.wav|The criminals are not exposed to view till they mount the fatal stage. The last part of the stage, or that next to the jail,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0042.wav|is enclosed by a temporary roof, under which are placed two seats for the reception of the sheriffs, one on each side of the stairs leading to the scaffold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0043.wav|Round the north, west, and south sides are erected galleries for the reception of officers, attendants, etc.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0046.wav|on the middle of which is placed the gibbet, extending from the jail across the Old Bailey.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0047.wav|This movable platform is raised six inches higher than the rest of the scaffold, and on it the convicts stand;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0054.wav|This contrivance appears to have been copied with improvements from that which had been used in Dublin at a still earlier date,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0062.wav|and this floor is supported below,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0064.wav|When the criminals are tied up and prepared for their fate, this floor suddenly falls down, upon withdrawing the supporters inwards.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0070.wav|The sentences inflicted in front of Newgate were not limited to hanging.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0071.wav|In the few years which elapsed between the establishment of the gallows at Newgate
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0072.wav|and the abolition of the practice of burning females for petty treason, more than one woman suffered this penalty at the Old Bailey.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0075.wav|She is described as a well-made little woman, something more than thirty years of age, of a pale complexion and not disagreeable features.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0077.wav|where the apparatus for the punishment she was about to experience
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0078.wav|seemed to strike her mind with horror and consternation, to the exclusion of all power of recollectedness in preparation for the approaching awful moment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0080.wav|She was immediately tied by the neck to an iron bolt fixed near the top of the stake,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0082.wav|A chain fastened by nails to the stake was then put round her body by the executioner with his assistants.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0084.wav|The flames presently burned the halter, the body fell a few inches, and hung then by the iron chain.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0085.wav|The fire had not quite burnt out at twelve, in nearly four hours, that is to say.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0088.wav|As many spectators as ever thronged to see the dreadful show,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0090.wav|It was still the custom to offer warm encouragement or bitter disapproval, according to the character and antecedents of the sufferer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0091.wav|The highwayman, whose exploits many in the crowd admired or emulated, was cheered and bidden to die game;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0092.wav|the man of better birth could hope for no sympathy, whatever his crime.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0093.wav|At the execution of Governor Wall, in eighteen oh two, the furious hatred of the mob was plainly apparent in their appalling cries.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0094.wav|His appearance on the scaffold was the signal for three prolonged shouts from an innumerable populace, "the brutal effusion of one common sentiment."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0098.wav|One was the "yeoman of the halter," a Newgate official, the executioner's assistant, whom Mr. J. T. Smith, who was present at the execution,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0110.wav|The prisoners had not risen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0111.wav|They entered a "stone cold room," and were presently joined by the prisoner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0112.wav|He was death's counterfeit, tall, shriveled, and pale;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0116.wav|and tied the cord with so little feeling that the governor (Wall), who had not given the wretch his accustomed fee, observed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0120.wav|"Do tell me, sir; I am informed I shall go down with great force; is it so?"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0123.wav|"Sir," he answered, "they sent me the very riff-raff."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0125.wav|The sheriff arrived, attended by his officers, to receive the prisoner from the keeper.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0126.wav|A new hat was partly flattened on his head, for, owing to its being too small in the crown, it stood many inches too high behind.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0131.wav|the other he kept between his hands.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0132.wav|Over the handkerchief around his brows he placed a white cap, the new hat being on top of all.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0135.wav|and stepped out on to the platform, to be received, as has been said, by prolonged yells.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0136.wav|These evidently deprived him of the small portion of fortitude he had summoned up.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0137.wav|He bowed his head under extreme pressure of ignominy,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0144.wav|in eighteen oh seven, an event long remembered from the fatal and disastrous consequences which followed it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0145.wav|They were accused by a confederate, who, goaded by conscience, had turned approver, of the murder of a Mr. Steele,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0148.wav|One night he was missing
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0151.wav|but in the beginning of eighteen oh seven one of them, at that time just sentenced to transportation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0154.wav|Conviction followed mainly on his testimony; but the two men, especially Holloway, stoutly maintained their innocence to the last.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0156.wav|An enormous crowd assembled to witness the execution, amounting, it was said, to the hitherto unparalleled number of forty thousand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0157.wav|By eight o'clock not an inch of ground in front of the platform was unoccupied.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0160.wav|some, especially of low stature, found it difficult to remain standing, and several, although held up for some time by the men nearest them,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0162.wav|Cries of Murder! murder! were now raised, and added greatly to the horrors of the scene.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0163.wav|Panic became general. More women, children, and many men were borne down, to perish beneath the feet of the rest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0164.wav|The most affecting and distressing scene was at Green Arbor Lane, just opposite the debtors' door of the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0166.wav|The pieman stooped down to pick up his scattered stock, and some of the mob, not seeing what had happened, stumbled over him.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0171.wav|and it passed along the heads of the crowd, to be caught at last by a person who struggled with it to a cart and deposited it there in safety.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0172.wav|In another part seven persons met their death by suffocation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0178.wav|the bodies for identification, the wounded to hospitals, a cart-load of shoes, hats, petticoats, and fragments of wearing apparel were picked up.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0180.wav|Among the dead was a sailor lad whom no one knew;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0181.wav|he had his pockets filled with bread and cheese, and it was generally supposed that he had come a long distance to see the fatal show.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0183.wav|but there were no serious accidents, beyond those caused by the goring of a maddened, over-driven ox which forced its way through the crowd.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0186.wav|The concourse was very great, notwithstanding these warnings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0187.wav|It was still greater at Fauntleroy's execution in eighteen twenty-four, when no less than one hundred thousand persons assembled, it was said.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0188.wav|Every window and roof which could command a view of the horrible performance was occupied.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0193.wav|by seven a.m. the whole space was so thronged that it was impossible to move one way or the other.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0194.wav|Some persons were kept for more than five hours standing against the barriers, and many nearly fainted from exhaustion.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0200.wav|hired a room for the night and morning, which he and a large party of friends occupied before and during the execution;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0201.wav|in an adjoining house, that of an undertaker, was Lord Alfred Paget, also with several friends.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0204.wav|One well-dressed woman fell out of a first-floor window on to the shoulders of the crowd below, but neither she nor any one else was greatly hurt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0206.wav|and caused a number of stout additional barriers to be erected in front of the scaffold,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0207.wav|and although one of these gave way owing to the extraordinary pressure, no serious accident occurred.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0212.wav|Cries of "Comfortable room!" "Excellent situation!" "Beautiful prospect!" "Splendid view!" resounded on every side.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0213.wav|By this time the workmen might be heard busily erecting the gallows;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0215.wav|One by one the huge uprights of black timber were fitted together,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0216.wav|until presently the huge stage loomed dark above the crowd which was now ranged round the barriers;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0218.wav|They were mainly members of the criminal classes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0219.wav|their conversation was of companions and associates of former years, long ago imprisoned, transported, hanged, while they,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0220.wav|hoary-headed and hardened in guilt, were still at large.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0221.wav|They talked of the days when the convicts were hung up a dozen or more in a row;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0222.wav|of those who had shown the white, and those who had died game.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0223.wav|The approaching ceremony had evidently no terrors for these "idolaters of the gallows."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0224.wav|With them were younger men and women:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0225.wav|the former already vowed to the same criminal career, and looking up to their elders with the respect due to successful practitioners;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0226.wav|the latter unsexed and brutalized by dissipation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0228.wav|their harsh and half-cracked voices full of maudlin, besotted sympathy for those about to die.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0231.wav|Hush! the unceasing murmur of the mob now breaks into a loud deep roar,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0232.wav|a sound as if the ocean had suddenly broken through some ancient boundary, against which its ever restless billows had for ages battered;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0233.wav|the wide dark sea of heads is all at once in motion;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0234.wav|each wave seems trying to overleap the other as they are drawn onwards towards this outlet.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0235.wav|Every link in that great human chain is shaken, along the whole lengthened line has the motion jarred, and each in turn sees,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0237.wav|The human hand that placed it there was only seen for a moment,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0238.wav|as it lay, white and ghastly, upon the black boards, and then again was as suddenly withdrawn, as if ashamed of the deed it had done.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0240.wav|Then followed sounds more distinct and audible, in which ginger-beer, pies, fried fish, sandwiches, and fruit
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0241.wav|were vended under the names of notorious murderers, highwaymen, and criminals,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0242.wav|famous in the annals of Newgate for the hardihood they had displayed in the hour of execution, when they terminated their career of crime at the gallows.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0246.wav|Never once from that pale face passed away its benign and patient expression.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0248.wav|Another fight followed the score which had already taken place; this time two women were the combatants.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0251.wav|was an hour before kicked to death by the savage and brutal mob.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0254.wav|It was followed by the deep and solemn booming of the death-bell from the church of St. Sepulchre
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0256.wav|and with blanched cheek, and sinking, we turned away from the scene.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0260.wav|One of the worst evils was the terrible and long-protracted uncertainty as to the result.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0262.wav|and with them indeed this dispatch amounted to undue precipitancy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0263.wav|Forty-eight hours was the limit of time allowed to the unhappy man to make his peace, and during that time he was still kept on a bare allowance of bread and water.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0268.wav|but of these three hundred and ninety-six were reversed by the king in council, and only fifty-two were really executed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0269.wav|Already the severity of our criminal code, and the number of capital felonies upon the statute book, had brought a reaction;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0271.wav|This was more particularly the practice in London.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0274.wav|The result in the latter case was left in the first place to the king in council,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0276.wav|Neither in town or country were cases entirely taken on their own merits.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0280.wav|The absurdity of the system, its irregularity and cruelty, were fully touched upon by the inspectors of prisons in their first report.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0284.wav|Nothing could be more strongly marked than the contrast between the ultimate destiny of different individuals all abiding the same awful doom:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0285.wav|on the one hand the gallows, on the other a short imprisonment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0287.wav|to make those sanctions an object of contemptuous mockery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0291.wav|The time thus spent varied considerably,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0292.wav|but it was seldom less than six weeks. It all depended upon the sovereign's disposition to do business.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0294.wav|nearly indefinitely deferred.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0295.wav|When the council had decided, the news was conveyed to Newgate by the Recorder, who made his "report," as it was called.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0297.wav|and its contents were anxiously awaited by both convicts in the press-yard and their friends collected in a crowd outside the gates.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0301.wav|during which they counted the moments -- the prisoners in their cells as usual, and their friends in the street in front of Newgate, where they passed the night.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0302.wav|I have heard the protracted agony of both classes described by those who witnessed it in terms so strong, that I am unwilling to repeat them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0303.wav|The crowd of men and women who passed the night in front of Newgate, began, as soon as the hour was passed when they had expected the report,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0308.wav|The Recorder's report generally reached Newgate late at night.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0313.wav|who in solemn tones communicated to each in turn the fate in store for him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0314.wav|The form of imparting the intelligence was generally the same.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0019.wav|that this resolution was in consequence of their (the aldermen's) disapproving of the last discourse delivered by me,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0020.wav|previous to the execution of Henry Fauntleroy for uttering a forged security
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0021.wav|in which it was said I had enlarged upon the heinous nature of his crime, and warned the public to avoid such conduct.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0022.wav|I was informed that this unnecessarily harassed his feelings, and that the object of such sermons was solely to console the prisoner,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0023.wav|and that from the time of his conviction nothing but what is consolatory should be addressed to a criminal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0024.wav|One of the aldermen, moreover, informed me that the whole court of aldermen were unanimous in their opinion on this subject.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0038.wav|In the center of the chapel was the condemned pew, a large dock-like erection painted black.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0039.wav|Those who sat in it were visible to the whole congregation, and still more to the ordinary,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0041.wav|The occupants of this terrible black pew were the last always to enter the chapel.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0044.wav|His features have no felonious cast;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0045.wav|he steps boldly with head upright, looks to the women's gallery, and smiles. His intention is to pass for a brave fellow,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0046.wav|but the attempt fails; he trembles, his knees knock together, and his head droops as he enters the condemned pew.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0048.wav|He is a hardened offender, previously cast for life, reprieved, transported to Australia, and since returned without pardon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0050.wav|He has, however, doubly earned his sentence, and is actually condemned for burglary committed since his arrival in England.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0054.wav|He is quite content to die;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0225.wav|but not before the greatest scandal had been caused by the unseemly proceedings of the crowd that flocked to see the sight. A sort of fair was held,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0111.wav|and there seems to have been good reason for supposing that he was a greater villain than any of those arraigned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0112.wav|He had been in a state of abject misery, and when he first joined "the reformers," as the Cato Street conspirators called themselves,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0113.wav|he had neither a bed to lie upon nor a coat to his back.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0114.wav|His sudden access to means unlimited was no doubt due to the profitable role he soon adopted of Government informer and spy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0115.wav|and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0116.wav|on the one inveigling silly enthusiasts to join in the plot, and denouncing them on the other.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0125.wav|and suffered in the usual way in front of Newgate, with the additional penalty of decapitation, as traitors, after they had been hanged.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0132.wav|As the executioner fastened the noose, he nodded to a friend he saw in the crowd;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0134.wav|He roared out snatches of a song about Death or Liberty, and just before he was turned off,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0137.wav|Davidson, who was the only one who seemed to realize his awful situation, listened patiently and with thankfulness to the chaplain,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0138.wav|and died in a manner strongly contrasting with that of his fellows.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0139.wav|After the five bodies had hung for half-an-hour, a man in a mask came forward to complete the sentence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0140.wav|Contemporary reports state that from the skillful manner in which he performed the decapitation,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0169.wav|sometimes in the Strand, or the West End.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0172.wav|He saw Prince Albert return there from a visit to Woolwich, and then passed on to Constitution Hill,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0174.wav|About six p.m. the royal carriage, a low open vehicle drawn by four horses, ridden by postilions, left the palace.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0175.wav|Oxford, who had been pacing backwards and forwards with his hands under the lapels of his coat, saw the carriage approach.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0176.wav|He was on the right or north side of the road. Prince Albert occupied the same side of the carriage, the Queen the left.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0179.wav|The Queen saw this second movement, and stooped to avoid the shot;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0181.wav|and the royal party drove back to Clarence House, the Queen being anxious to give the first news of the outrage and of her safety to her mother,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0185.wav|But Oxford at once assumed the responsibility for his crime, saying, "It was I. I did it. I'll give myself up.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0189.wav|He asked more than once whether the Queen was hurt, and acknowledged that the pistols were loaded with ball.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0190.wav|A craze for notoriety, to be achieved at any cost, was the one absorbing idea in young Oxford's disordered brain.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0191.wav|After his arrest he thought only of the excitement his attempt had raised, nothing of its atrocity,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0192.wav|or of the fatal consequences which might have ensued.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0193.wav|When brought to trial he hardly realized his position,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0194.wav|but gazed with complacency around the crowded court, and eagerly inquired what persons of distinction were present.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0196.wav|These antics may have been assumed to bear out the plea of insanity set up in his defense,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0199.wav|Among his papers was found a curious document, purporting to be the rules of an association called
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0200.wav|"Young England," which Oxford had evolved out of his own inflated self-conceit, and which had never any real corporeal existence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0201.wav|"Young England" was a secret society, with no aim or object.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0202.wav|Its sworn members, known only to Oxford, and all of them mere shadows,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0203.wav|were bound to provide themselves with sword, rifle, dagger, and a pair of pistols;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0205.wav|and to assume any disguise, if required to go into the country on the business of the association.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0206.wav|The officers of the society were to be known only by "factitious names."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0207.wav|Thus, among the presidents were those of Gowrie, Justinian, Aloman, Colsman, Kenneth, and Godfrey;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0209.wav|Louis and Amadeus among the captains; and Hercules, Neptune, and Mars among the lieutenants of the association.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0210.wav|The various grades were distinguished by cockades and bows of different colors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0214.wav|One expressed pleasure that Oxford improved so much in speaking, and declared that his (Oxford's) speech the last time "was beautiful."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0217.wav|Soon after he was introduced we were alarmed by a violent knocking at the door;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0218.wav|in an instant our faces were covered, we cocked our pistols, and with drawn swords stood waiting to receive the enemy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0220.wav|We then sent the old woman to open the door, and it proved to be some little boys who had knocked and ran away.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0221.wav|Another letter directed Oxford to attend an extraordinary meeting of "Young England"

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0228.wav|He was released from Broadmoor in eighteen seventy-eight, and went abroad.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0230.wav|who was arrested in the very act, just as he had fired one shot.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0233.wav|Here again probably it was partly the love of notoriety which was the incentive,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0234.wav|backed possibly with the hope that, as in a much more recent case,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0236.wav|The deed was long premeditated, and would have been executed a day earlier had not his courage failed him at the last moment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0240.wav|The Queen was apprised of the danger, and begged not to go abroad;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0243.wav|with an equerry riding close on each side of her carriage, a man who had been leaning against the palace garden wall suddenly advanced,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0244.wav|leveled a pistol at the Queen, and fired. He was so close to the carriage that the smoke of his pistol enveloped the face of Colonel Wylde,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0246.wav|Francis had already been seized by a policeman named Trounce, who saw his movement with the pistol, but too late to prevent its discharge.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0247.wav|The prisoner was conveyed without delay to the Home Office, and there examined by the Privy Council, which had been hastily summoned for the purpose.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0249.wav|There was some doubt as to whether the pistol when fired was actually loaded with ball, but the jury brought in a verdict of guilty
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0250.wav|of the criminal intent to kill.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0251.wav|Francis was sentenced to be hanged, decapitated, and quartered,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0253.wav|The enthusiasm of the people at the Queen's escape was uproarious, and her drive next day was one long triumphal progress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0256.wav|Undeterred by the well-merited punishment which had overtaken Francis,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0259.wav|a deformed lad among the crowd was seen to present a pistol at Her Majesty's carriage,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0263.wav|The policemen treated the matter as a hoax, and allowed the culprit to make off.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0264.wav|Later on, however, Dasset was himself seized and interrogated,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0266.wav|and a long, sickly, pale face, with light hair;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0269.wav|whose description, as given by his father to the police,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0270.wav|exactly tallied with that of the deformed person "wanted" for the assault on the Queen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0271.wav|A visit to the father's residence was followed by the arrest of the son, who had by this time returned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0272.wav|This son, John William Bean, was fully identified by Dasset, and presently examined by the Privy Council.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0273.wav|He was eventually charged with a misdemeanor, the capital charge having been abandoned, and committed for trial.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0276.wav|and he was only convicted of an attempt "to harass, vex, and grieve the sovereign.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0279.wav|I shall mention briefly one more case, in which, however, there was no murderous intent, before I pass on to other crimes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0280.wav|On June eighteen fifty the Queen was once more subjected to cowardly outrage, the offender being a Mr. Pate, a gentleman by birth,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0282.wav|Pate was said to be an eccentric person, given to strange acts and antics, such as mixing whiskey and camphor with his morning bath-water,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0287.wav|But this was not sufficient to constitute lunacy, nor was his plea of "momentary uncontrollable impulse"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0289.wav|That offense was a brutal assault upon Her Majesty, whom he struck in the face with a small stick just as she was leaving Cambridge House.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0290.wav|The blow crushed the bonnet and bruised the forehead of the Queen, who was happily not otherwise injured.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0291.wav|Pate was found guilty, and sentenced to seven years' transportation, the judge, Baron Alderson, abstaining from inflicting the penalty of whipping,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0292.wav|which was authorized by a recent act, on account of Mr. Pate's family and position in life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0295.wav|The increase of bank forgeries, and its cause, I referred to in a previous chapter.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0296.wav|At one session of the Old Bailey, in eighteen twenty-one, no less than thirty-five true bills were found for passing forged notes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0298.wav|That of Fauntleroy the banker, in eighteen twenty-four,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0300.wav|Mr. Fauntleroy was a member of a banking firm, which his father had established in conjunction with a gentleman of the name of Marsh, and others.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0302.wav|in eighteen oh seven, and when only twenty-two, he succeeded to his father's share in the business.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0304.wav|through advances made to various builders, and that it could only maintain its credit by wholesale discounting.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0306.wav|and the bank became liable for a sum of one hundred seventy thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0311.wav|in other words, he forged powers of attorney, and proceeded to realize securities lodged in his bank under various names.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0317.wav|The bank began first to refuse our acceptances, and to destroy the credit of our house; the bank shall smart for it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0002.wav|Many stories were in circulation at the time of Fauntleroy's trial with regard to his forgeries. It was said that he had by means of them
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0006.wav|He went to the bank, and found that no stocks stood in her name. He called at once upon Fauntleroy, his client's bankers, for an explanation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0007.wav|and was told by Mr. Fauntleroy that the lady had desired him to sell out, "which I have done," added the fraudulent banker, "and here are the proceeds,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0008.wav|whereupon he produced exchequer bills to the amount.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0009.wav|Nothing more was heard of the affair, although the lady declared that she had never instructed Fauntleroy to sell.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0010.wav|On another occasion the banker forged a gentleman's name while the latter was sitting with him in his private room,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0012.wav|It must be added that the Bank of England, on discovering the forgeries,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0013.wav|replaced the stock in the names of the original holders, who might otherwise have been completely ruined.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0016.wav|His countenance had an expression of most subdued resignation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0018.wav|The crime, long carried on without detection, was first discovered in eighteen twenty,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0020.wav|had been sold out under a forged power of attorney.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0021.wav|Further investigations brought other similar frauds to light,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0024.wav|Meanwhile public gossip was busy with Fauntleroy's name,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0025.wav|and it was openly stated in the press and in conversation that the proceeds of these frauds had been squandered in chambering, gambling, and debauchery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0026.wav|Fauntleroy was scouted as a licentious libertine, a deep and determined gamester, a spendthrift whose extravagance knew no bounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0030.wav|was substantially true
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0037.wav|Appeals were made to the Home Secretary, and all possible political interest brought to bear, but without success.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0038.wav|Fauntleroy meanwhile lay in Newgate, not herded with other condemned prisoners, as the custom was,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0039.wav|but in a separate chamber, that belonging to one of the warders of the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0040.wav|I find in the chaplain's journal, under date eighteen twenty-four, various entries relative to this prisoner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0041.wav|Visited Mr. Fauntleroy. My application for books for him not having been attended, I had no prayer-book to give him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0042.wav|Visited Mr. Fauntleroy. The sheriffs have very kindly permitted him to remain in the turnkey's room where he was originally placed; nor can I omit expressing a hope
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0043.wav|that this may prove the beginning of a better system of confinement, and that every description of persons who may be unfortunately under sentence of death
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0044.wav|will no longer be herded indiscriminately together.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0045.wav|The kindliness of the city authorities to Fauntleroy was not limited to the assignment of a separate place of durance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0046.wav|As I have already said, they took the chaplain seriously to task for the bad taste shown in the condemned sermon preached before Fauntleroy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0047.wav|This was on the text,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0054.wav|A very curious and, in its way, amusing circumstance in connection with this case was the offer of a certain Italian,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0058.wav|He was summoned to the Mansion House, where he repeated his request, crying, "Accordez moi cette grâce," with much urgency.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0059.wav|There were doubts of his sanity.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0062.wav|If the law of this country can receive such a sacrifice, my death will render to heaven an innocent man, and to earth a repentant sinner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0064.wav|He was also attended by the Rev. Mr. Springett and the indefatigable Mr. Baker, whose name has already been mentioned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0067.wav|A report was, moreover, widely circulated, and the impression long prevailed, that he actually escaped death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0070.wav|Afterwards, according to the common rumor, he went abroad and lived there for many years; but the story is not only wholly unsubstantiated,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0071.wav|but there is good evidence to show that the body after execution was handed over to his friends and interred privately.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0072.wav|Some years were still to elapse before capital punishment ceased to be the penalty for forgery, and in the interval
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0074.wav|There were two notable capital convictions for forgery in eighteen twenty-eight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0075.wav|One was that of Captain Montgomery, who assumed the aliases of Colonel Wallace and Colonel Morgan.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0076.wav|His offense was uttering forged notes, and there was strong suspicion that he had long subsisted entirely by this fraud.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0077.wav|The act for which he was taken into custody was the payment of a forged ten-pound note for half-a-dozen silver spoons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0080.wav|His first forgery was the marvelous imitation of the signature of the Hon. Mr. Neville, M.P., who wrote an extremely cramped and curious hand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0081.wav|He was not prosecuted for this fraud on account of the respectability of his family, and soon after this escape
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0083.wav|For a long time justice did not overtake him for any criminal offense, but he was frequently in Newgate and in the King's Bench for debt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0084.wav|After three years' confinement in the latter prison he passed himself off as his brother, Colonel Montgomery,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0086.wav|He then took to forging bank-notes, and was arrested as I have described above.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0087.wav|Montgomery was duly sentenced to death, but he preferred suicide to the gallows. After sentence his demeanor was serious yet firm.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0089.wav|and listened attentively to the ordinary, who read him the well-known address written and delivered by Dr. Dodd previous to his own execution for forgery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0091.wav|In one corner after much search a phial was found labeled "Prussic acid,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0096.wav|He married a lady also belonging to the Society of Friends, who brought him a large fortune, which, and his own money, he put into a city firm,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0101.wav|Hunton tried to fly the country on the detection of the fraud, but was arrested at Plymouth just as he was on the point of leaving England in the New York packet.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0102.wav|He had gone on board in his Quaker dress, but when captured was found in a light-green frock,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0103.wav|a pair of light gray pantaloons, a black stock and a foraging cap.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0106.wav|Hunton accepted his sentence with great resignation, although he protested against the inhumanity of the laws which condemned him to death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0111.wav|Two elders of the meeting sat up with him in the press yard the whole of the night previous to execution, and a third,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0112.wav|Mr. Sparks Moline, came to attend him to the scaffold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0113.wav|He met his death with unshaken firmness, only entreating that a certain blue handkerchief,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0115.wav|Hunton's execution no doubt aroused public attention to the cruelty and futility of the capital law against forgery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0116.wav|A society which had already been started against capital punishment

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0172.wav|Mr. Turner was on the verge of bankruptcy. He was at that moment at Kendal, and wished her to join him there at once.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0176.wav|He now pretended that Mr. Turner was also on his way to the border, pursued by sheriffs' officers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0177.wav|The fact was, Wakefield went on to say, an uncle of his had advanced Mr. Turner sixty thousand pounds, which had temporarily staved off ruin.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0180.wav|Wakefield added that it had been suggested he should marry Miss Turner, but that he had laughed at the idea.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0181.wav|Wakefield's uncle took the matter more seriously, and declared that unless the marriage came off Mr. Turner must be sold up.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0191.wav|The strangely-married couple thereupon pressed on to Dover, and crossed over to Calais.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0192.wav|The fact of the abduction did not transpire for some days.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0198.wav|An uncle of Miss Wakefield's, accompanied by his solicitor and a Bow Street runner, at once went in pursuit.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0209.wav|He surrendered the bride who had never been a wife, and she returned to England with her friends, while Wakefield went on alone to Paris.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0243.wav|Mr. Mullay went, and a second interview was agreed upon, when a third person, Mr. Owen,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0245.wav|Mr. Mullay called again, taking with him five hundred pounds in cash. Howard discovered this, and his manner was very suspicious;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0247.wav|Mr. Mullay became alarmed, and as Mr. Owen did not appear, withdrew;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0248.wav|Howard, strange to say, making no attempt to detain him; probably because Mullay promised to return a few days later, and to bring more money.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0250.wav|While thus engaged, Howard thrust the poker into the fire.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0253.wav|Mullay defended himself, and managed to break the knife, but not before he had cut himself severely.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0254.wav|A life and death struggle ensued. Mullay cried "Murder!"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0255.wav|Howard swore he would finish him, but proved the weaker of the two, and Mullay got him down on the floor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0257.wav|Howard was secured, given into custody, and committed to Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0263.wav|It was perpetrated upon a respectable country solicitor,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0264.wav|Mr. Gee, of Bishop Stortford, who administered the estate of a certain Mr. Canning, deceased.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0265.wav|This Mr. Canning had left his widow a life interest in two thousand pounds so long as she remained unmarried.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0267.wav|Mr. Gee had invested one thousand two hundred pounds of this, and was seeking how best to place the remaining eight hundred pounds,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0268.wav|when he was asked to meet a Mr. Heath in London with regard to the sale of certain lands at Bishop Stortford.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0272.wav|The coach immediately drove off; Mr. Gee entered the house, asked for Mr. Heath, was told he would find him in the back kitchen at breakfast.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0273.wav|He was about to descend the stairs when three persons, one of them the young sailor,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0280.wav|Mr. Gee at first stoutly refused.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0283.wav|One was a cheque for eight hundred pounds on his bankers, the other an order to Mr. Bell of Newport, Essex, requesting the surrender of a deed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0284.wav|His captors having thus succeeded in their designs, left him, no doubt to realize the money.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0285.wav|The door of his place of durance stood open, and Mr. Gee began to consider whether he might not escape.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0287.wav|but at length managed to wriggle out of the chain which confined his body, and soon loosened the ropes round his feet.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0288.wav|Thus free, he eluded the vigilance of two of the party, who were at dinner in the front kitchen,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0007.wav|Edwards, whom Mr. Gee easily identified with the others, at once admitted that he was the prime mover of the conspiracy.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0012.wav|All three men were committed for trial, although Edwards wished to exculpate the others as having only acted under his order.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0013.wav|At the trial the indictment charging them with felony could not be sustained, but they were found guilty of conspiracy and assault.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0016.wav|At no period could thieves in London or elsewhere have prospered had they been unable to dispose of their ill-gotten goods.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0019.wav|The name of Ikey Solomons was long remembered by thief and thief-taker.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0024.wav|On his release an uncle, a slop-seller in Chatham, gave him a situation as "barker," or salesman,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0027.wav|He had such great aptitude for business, and such a thorough knowledge of the real value of goods,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0028.wav|that he was soon admitted to be one of the best judges known of all kinds of property, from a glass bottle to a five hundred guinea chronometer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0030.wav|Thus, a watch was paid for as a watch, whether it was of gold or silver; a piece of linen as such, whether the stuff was coarse or fine.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0031.wav|This rule in dealing with stolen goods continues to this day, and has made the fortune of many since Ikey.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0032.wav|Solomons also established a system of provincial agency, by which stolen goods were passed on from London to the seaports, and so abroad.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0033.wav|Jewels were re-set,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0036.wav|On one occasion the whole of the proceeds of a robbery from a boot shop was traced to Solomons';
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0038.wav|but could not positively identify it, and Ikey defied them to remove a single shoe.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0039.wav|In the end the injured bootmaker agreed to buy back his stolen stock
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0041.wav|As a general rule Ikey Solomons confined his purchases to small articles, mostly of jewelery and plate,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0047.wav|But it was eventually discovered by Mrs. Solomons, a very jealous wife,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0048.wav|and this, with the danger arising from an extensive robbery of watches in Cheapside, in which Ikey was implicated as a receiver,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0054.wav|Solomons, while waiting to appear in court, persuaded the turnkeys to take him to a public-house, where all might "refresh."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0061.wav|On stopping at a door in this low street, Ikey jumped out, ran into the house, slamming the door behind him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0062.wav|He passed through and out at the back, and was soon beyond pursuit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0066.wav|and begged his wife to send him over a consignment of cheap "righteous" watches, or such as had been honestly obtained, and not "on the cross."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0067.wav|But Mrs. Solomons could not resist the temptation to dabble in stolen goods, and she was found shipping watches of the wrong category to New York.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0068.wav|For this she received a sentence of fourteen years' transportation, and was sent to Van Diemen's Land.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0069.wav|Ikey joined her at Hobart Town, where they set up a general shop, and soon began to prosper.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0071.wav|which presently followed, and again found himself an inmate of Newgate, waiting trial as a receiver and a prison-breaker.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0072.wav|He was indicted on eight charges, two only of which were substantiated, but on each of them he received a sentence of seven years' transportation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0074.wav|Whether Ikey was "assigned" to his own family is not recorded, but no doubt he succeeded to his own property when the term of servitude had expired.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0075.wav|No doubt, on the removal of Ikey Solomons from the scene, his mantle fell upon worthy successors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0076.wav|There was an increase rather than an abatement in jewel and bullion robberies in the years immediately following,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0077.wav|and the thieves seem to have had no difficulty in disposing of their spoil.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0078.wav|One of the largest robberies of its class was that effected upon the Custom House in the winter of eighteen thirty-four.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0079.wav|A large amount of specie was nearly always retained here in the department of the Receiver of Fines.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0081.wav|Being inexperienced, they decided to call in the services of a couple of professional housebreakers,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0090.wav|He went out next morning with the booty when the doors were re-opened, and attracted no attention.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0091.wav|The spoil was fairly divided; part of the notes were disposed of to a traveling "receiver," who passed over to the Continent and there cashed them easily.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0093.wav|and the police were unable at first to get on the track of the thieves.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0094.wav|While the excitement was still fresh, a new robbery of diamonds was committed at a bonded warehouse in the immediate neighborhood, on Custom House Quay.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0099.wav|The thieves it was supposed had secreted themselves in the warehouse during business hours, and waited till night to carry out their plans.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0101.wav|They had had serious work to get at the diamonds. It was necessary to force one heavy door from its hinges, and to cut through the thick panels of another.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0103.wav|which if introduced into a keyhole, and worked like a bit and brace, will soon destroy the strongest lock.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0104.wav|The thieves were satisfied with the diamonds; they broke open other cases containing gold watches and plate, but abstracted nothing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0107.wav|About this time also suspicion fell upon Huey, one of the clerks, who was arrested soon afterwards, and made a clean breast of the whole affair.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0108.wav|There was a hunt for the two well-known house-breakers, who were eventually heard of at a lodging in Kennington.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0109.wav|But they at once made tracks, and took up their residence under assumed names in a tavern in Bloomsbury.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0110.wav|The police lost all trace of them for some days, but at length Sullivan's brother was followed from the house in Kennington to the above-mentioned tavern.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0117.wav|By-and-by the occupant of the room noticed something glittering in the center of the fire, which, to inspect more closely, he took out with the tongs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0118.wav|It was a large gold brooch set in pearls, but a portion of the mounting had melted with the heat.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0121.wav|A part of the "swag" stolen from the bonded warehouse was thus recovered, but it was supposed that a number of the stolen notes had perished in the fire.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0065.wav|and that he gained access to Miss Slack on pretense of conveying to her some funded property left her by an aunt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0066.wav|By this means her signature was obtained; a forged will was prepared bequeathing the unclaimed stock to Miss Slack;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0166.wav|While Courvoisier opened the shutters, the housemaid, approaching the bed, saw that the pillow was saturated with blood.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0186.wav|Behind the skirting board several of his lordship's rings were discovered;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0195.wav|induced the prisoner to make a full confession of his crime to the lawyers who defended him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0196.wav|This placed them in a position of much embarrassment. To have thrown up their brief would have been to have secured Courvoisier's conviction.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0183.wav|meaning to kill him and rifle the shop.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0184.wav|The noise of the struggle was heard outside in the street,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0190.wav|Marley, disturbed, picked up a cigar and parcel from the counter, then ran out, pursued by Lerigo only.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0191.wav|Marley ran along the street, down into Cannon Row
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0192.wav|then into Palace Yard, where the waterman of the cab-tank, in obedience to Lerigo's shouts, collared the fugitive.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0195.wav|two of them supported Cope, who was still alive, although insensible, and Marley was apprehended. The evidence against him was completed

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0198.wav|Marley at his trial was undefended, and the sheriffs offered him counsel; but he declined. The witnesses against him all spoke the truth, he said;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0205.wav|On the dread morning he came out to execution quite gaily, and tripped up the stairs to the scaffold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0208.wav|A murderous assault on a police constable, which so nearly ended fatally that the culprit was sentenced to death, although not executed,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0211.wav|and had been repeatedly sentenced to imprisonment for most desperate and ferocious attacks upon various constables. His last victim was Dwyer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0212.wav|a fine young officer who had been summoned to take Cannon into custody when the latter was drunk and riotous in front of a public-house.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0222.wav|To Cannon's infinite surprise, he was indicted for attempt to murder, and not for a simple assault, and found guilty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0225.wav|A handsome sum was subscribed for the injured constable, who was disabled for life.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0254.wav|This he did to an enormous extent,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0255.wav|continually altering, erasing, and adding figures to correspond with and cover the abstractions he made of various cheques as they were drawn.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0256.wav|It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0258.wav|Implicit confidence appears to have been placed in Watts, who was the son of an old and trusted employee, and, moreover, a young man of plausible address.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0259.wav|Watts led two lives.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0260.wav|In the West End he was a man of fashion, with a town house, a house at Brighton, and a cellar full of good wine at both.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0263.wav|When other pleasures palled he took a theatre, and posed as a munificent patron of the dramatic art.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0265.wav|and later he became manager of the newly rebuilt Olympic at Wych Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0266.wav|No one cared too closely to inquire into the sources of wealth. Some said he was a fortunate speculator in stocks,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0277.wav|An inquiry was at once set on foot, and the frauds were traced to Watts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0278.wav|The latter, when first taxed with his offense, protested his innocence boldly, and positively denied all knowledge of the affair;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0279.wav|and he had so cleverly destroyed all traces that it was not easy to bring home the charge.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0281.wav|which he had paid into his own bankers, and on this he was committed to Newgate for trial.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0282.wav|There were two counts in the indictment: one for stealing a cheque value fourteen hundred pounds, the second for stealing a bit of paper value one penny.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0283.wav|The jury found him guilty of the latter only, with a point of law reserved. This was fully argued before three judges,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0287.wav|He had been led to suppose that twelve months' imprisonment was the utmost the law could inflict, and he broke down utterly under the unexpected blow.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0289.wav|The details of the suicide were given at the inquest. Watts had been in ill-health from the time of his first arrest.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0294.wav|and in the middle of the night one of the fellow-prisoners who slept in the same ward noticed that he was not in his bed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0295.wav|This man got up to look for him, and found him hanging from the bars of a neighboring room.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0296.wav|He had made use of a piece of rope cut out from the sacking of his bedstead, and had tied his feet together with a silk pocket-handkerchief.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0304.wav|He was a corn merchant who operated largely in grain.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0305.wav|So enormous were his transactions, that they often affected the markets, and caused great fluctuations in prices.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0306.wav|These had been attributed to political action; some thought that the large purchases in foreign grains, effected at losing prices,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0308.wav|others, that Napoleon the third, but recently proclaimed Emperor of the French, wished to gain the popularity necessary to secure the people.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0310.wav|Pries, although enjoying a high reputation in the city, had long been in a bad way.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0313.wav|In this way he obtained vast sums from several firms, and one to which he was indebted upwards of fifty thousand pounds subsequently stopped payment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0315.wav|through a dishonored cheque for three thousand pounds, paid over as an installment of eighteen thousand pounds owing for an advance on warrants.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0318.wav|Another set of frauds, which resembled those of Pries in principle, although not in practice, were soon afterwards discovered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0320.wav|proposed to gain the capital he needed for business purposes by raising money on dock warrants for imported goods which had no real existence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0322.wav|The dock warrant was issued by the wharfinger as certificate that he held the goods.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0326.wav|Maltby and Co. would issue warrants on them deliverable to the importer, and the goods were then passed to be stored in neighboring warehouses.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0327.wav|The owners of the latter would then issue a second set of warrants on these goods, in total ignorance of the fact that they were already pledged.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0328.wav|Cole quickly raised money on both sets of warrants. He carried on this game for some time with great success,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0329.wav|and so developed his business that in one year his transactions amounted to a couple of millions of pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0333.wav|Again, some of the duplicate and fictitious warrants were held by a firm which suspended payment, and there was no knowing into whose hands they might fall.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0334.wav|Cole found out where they were, and redeemed them at a heavy outlay, thus obtaining business relations with the firm that held them,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0335.wav|which were soon developed, much to that firm's subsequent anger and regret.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0336.wav|Last of all, the well-known bankers Overend and Gurney, whose own affairs created much excitement some years later,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0339.wav|asked Davidson and Gordon, a firm with which Cole was closely allied, whether the warrants meant goods or nothing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0003.wav|A firm which held a lot of warrants suddenly demanded the delivery of the goods they covered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0004.wav|The goods having no existence, Cole of course could not deliver them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0007.wav|This affected Cole's credit, and ugly reports were in circulation charging him with the issue of simulated warrants.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0008.wav|These indeed were out to the value of three hundred sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0009.wav|Cole's difficulties increased more and more; warrant-holders came down upon him demanding to realize their goods.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0011.wav|Maltby, who had bolted, was pursued and arrested, to end his life miserably by committing suicide in a Newgate cell.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0012.wav|Cole too was apprehended, and in due course tried at the Central Criminal Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0013.wav|He was found guilty, and sentenced to the seemingly inadequate punishment of four years' transportation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0015.wav|A more distressing case stands next on the criminal records --
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0016.wav|the failure and subsequent sentence of the bankers Messrs. Strahan, Paul, and Bates,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0023.wav|Mr. Bates had been confidential managing clerk, and was taken into the firm not alone as a reward for long and faithful service
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0024.wav|but that he might strengthen it by his long experience and known business capacity.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0026.wav|Moreover, the partners were sober, steady men, who paid unremitting attention to business.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0027.wav|Yet even so early as the death of the first Sir John Paul,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0028.wav|the bank was insolvent, and instead of starting on a fresh life with a new name, it should then and there have closed its doors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0031.wav|it had assumed enormous responsibilities -- on one side by the ownership of the Mostyn collieries, a valueless property,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0035.wav|produced immediate embarrassment and financial distress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0037.wav|and the partners had to decide between suspending payment or continuing to hold its head above water by flagitious processes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0040.wav|This borrowing continued, and on such a scale that their paper was soon at a discount,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0042.wav|Then it was that instead of merely pledging securities, the bank sold them outright, and thus passed the Rubicon of fraud.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0044.wav|with money enough to retrieve the position of the bank. But that passed from bad to worse;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0048.wav|But worse than the bankruptcy was the confession made by the partners in the court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0052.wav|to the value of twenty thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0055.wav|Next morning they only just saved the train to town, and left Sir John behind on the platform, but he subsequently surrendered himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0058.wav|Bates, the least guilty, was pardoned in eighteen fifty-eight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0060.wav|will long be remembered both within and without the commercial world.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0063.wav|But neither Robson nor Redpath would have been able to pursue their fraudulent designs with success had they not, like Watts,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0064.wav|been afforded peculiar facilities by the slackness of system and the want of methodical administration in the concerns by which they were employed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0065.wav|Robson was of humble origin, but he was well educated, and he had some literary abilities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0072.wav|He had a pleasant address, showed good business aptitudes, and quickly acquired the approval of his superiors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0073.wav|Within a year he was advanced to the post of chief clerk in the transfer department, at a salary of one hundred fifty pounds a year.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0074.wav|His immediate chief was a Mr. Fasson, upon whose confidence he gained so rapidly, through his activity, industry, and engaging manners,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0075.wav|that ere long the whole management of the transfer department was entrusted to him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0076.wav|Some time elapsed before Robson succumbed to temptation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0078.wav|who preferred to risk his future reputation and liberty to the present discomfort of living upon narrow means.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0080.wav|Shares in the company were represented by certificates, which often enough never left the company's, or more exactly Robson's, hands.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0081.wav|He conceived the idea of transferring shares, bogus shares from a person who held none, to any one who would buy them in the open market.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0082.wav|He took it for granted that the certificates representing these bogus shares, and which practically did not exist, would never be called for.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0083.wav|This ingenious method of raising funds he adopted and carried on without detection,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0084.wav|till the defalcations from fraudulent transfers and fraudulent issues combined amounted to twenty-seven thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0090.wav|To account for his revenues he pretended to have been very lucky on the Stock Exchange, which was at one time true to a limited extent,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0091.wav|and to have succeeded in other speculations.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0092.wav|When his friends asked why he, a wealthy man of independent means, continued to slave on as a clerk on a pittance,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0094.wav|All this time his position was one of extreme insecurity. He was standing over a mine which at any moment might explode.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0095.wav|The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0096.wav|whether representing real or fictitious shares does not appear; but they were certificates connected in some way with Robson's long practiced frauds
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0097.wav|and he could not produce them. His chief asked sternly where they were.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0098.wav|Robson said they were at Kilburn Priory.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0099.wav|"Let us go to Kilburn for them together," said Mr. Fasson, growing suspicious.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0100.wav|They drove there, and Robson on arrival did the honors of his house, rang for lunch to gain time,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0101.wav|but at Mr. Fasson's pressing demands went upstairs to fetch the certificates.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0102.wav|He came back to explain that he had mislaid them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0105.wav|Mr. Fasson waited and waited for his subordinate to re-appear, and at last discovered his flight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0108.wav|where a fish curry and a brace of partridges were set before him,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0109.wav|and he discussed the latter with appetite, but begged that they would never give him curry again, as he did not like it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0110.wav|After dinner he went into hiding for a day or two,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0113.wav|followed him over to Sweden, and arrested him at Helsingfors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0115.wav|Little more remains to be said about Robson. He appears to have accepted his position, and to have at once resigned himself to his fate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0116.wav|When brought to trial he took matters very coolly, and at first pleaded "Not Guilty," but subsequently withdrew the plea.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0121.wav|Newgate officers who remember Robson still describe him as a fine young man, who behaved well as a prisoner,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0122.wav|but who had all the appearance of a careless, thoughtless, happy-go-lucky fellow.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0124.wav|but it was based upon more extended and audacious forgeries.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0125.wav|Redpath's crime arose from his peculiar and independent position as registrar of stock of the Great Northern Railway Company.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0127.wav|All the signatures in the transfer were forged. Not only did he thus transfer and realize "bogus" stock
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0128.wav|but he bought bona fide amounts, and increased their value by altering the figures,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0131.wav|By these means Redpath misappropriated vast sums during a period extending over ten years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0134.wav|had assets in the shape of land, house, furniture, pictures, and objets d'art to the value of fifty thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0135.wav|He began in a very small way.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0137.wav|afterwards he set up as an insurance broker on his own account, but presently failed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0139.wav|an open-handed, unthinking charity which gave freely to the poor and needy the money which belonged to his creditors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0144.wav|developed to a colossal extent the frauds he had already practiced as a subordinate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0146.wav|He had a nice taste in bric-à-brac, and was considered a good judge of pictures.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0148.wav|The choicest wines, the finest fruits,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0150.wav|But his chief extravagance, his favorite folly, was the exercise of an ostentatious benevolence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0151.wav|The philanthropy he had displayed in a small way when less prosperous became now a passion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0152.wav|His name headed every subscription list; his purse was always open.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0155.wav|that so good a man had really been for years a swindler and a rogue.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0156.wav|Down at Weybridge, where he had a country place, his name was long remembered with gratitude by the poor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0161.wav|There was something dramatic in Redpath's detection
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0163.wav|was standing at a railway station talking to a certain well-known peer of the realm.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0164.wav|Redpath passed and lifted his hat to his chairman; the latter acknowledged the salute.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0165.wav|But the peer rushed forward and shook Redpath warmly by the hand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0166.wav|"What do you know of our clerk?" asked Mr. Denison of his lordship. "Only that he is a capital fellow, who gives the best dinners and balls in town."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0168.wav|but the chairman of the Great Northern could not realize that a clerk of the company could honestly be in the possession of unlimited wealth.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0169.wav|It was at once decided at the board to make a thorough examination of all his books.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0174.wav|Thither police officers followed, only to find that he had returned to London.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0175.wav|A further search discovered him at breakfast at a small house in the New Road.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0180.wav|was densely crowded, and many curious eyes were turned upon the somewhat remarkable man who occupied the dock.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0181.wav|He is described by a contemporary account as a fresh-looking man of forty years of age, slightly bald, inclined to embonpoint,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0184.wav|and he looked about him with wayward, furtive glances.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0191.wav|In Newgate Redpath is remembered by the prison officer as a difficult man to deal with.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0192.wav|From the moment of his reception he gave himself great airs, as a martyr and a man heavily wronged.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0193.wav|By-and-by, when escape seemed hopeless, and after sentence, he suddenly degenerated into the lowest stamp of criminal,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0196.wav|Highway robberies, for instance, had disappeared, if we except the spasmodic and severely repressed outbreak of "garotting,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0197.wav|which at one time spread terror throughout London. Thieves preferred now to use ingenuity rather than brute force.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0199.wav|The improved methods of locomotion had put a stop to these depredations. People traveled in company, as a rule;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0203.wav|but were the precautions too minute, the vigilance too close to be eluded or overcome?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0204.wav|This was the question which presented itself to the fertile brain of one Pierce,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0205.wav|who had been concerned in various "jobs" of a dishonest character, and who for the moment was a clerk in a betting office.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0208.wav|they sounded one Burgess, a guard on the South-Eastern Railway, a line by which large quantities of bullion were sent to the Continent.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0210.wav|The gold, packed in an iron-bound box, was securely lodged in safes locked with patent Chubbs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0211.wav|Each safe had three sets of double keys, all held by confidential servants of the company.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0212.wav|One pair was with the traffic superintendent in London, another with an official in Folkestone,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0213.wav|a third with the captain of the Folkestone and Boulogne boat.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0215.wav|The safes while on the line en route between London and Folkestone were in the guard's van.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0218.wav|A new accomplice was now needed within the company's establishment, and Pierce looked about long before he found the right person.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0223.wav|He lent it to Agar for a brief space, who promptly took an impression on wax. But the safes had a double lock;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0227.wav|Still watching and waiting for the first chance, they seized it when the clerks left the office empty for a moment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0228.wav|Pierce boldly stepped in, found the cupboard unlocked; he removed the key, handed it to Agar outside,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0230.wav|After this nothing remained but to wait for some occasion when the amount transmitted would be sufficient to justify the risks of robbery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0232.wav|Meanwhile the others completed their preparations with the utmost care.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0234.wav|Courier bags were bought to carry the "stuff" slung over the shoulders;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0235.wav|and last, but not least, Agar frequently traveled up and down the line to test the false keys he had manufactured with Pierce's assistance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0237.wav|One night Tester whispered to Agar and Pierce, "All right," as they cautiously lounged about London Bridge.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0239.wav|Just as the train was starting Agar slipped into the van with Burgess, and Pierce got into a first-class carriage.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0240.wav|Agar at once got to work on the first safe.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0244.wav|At the same station Pierce joined Agar in the guard's van, and there were now three to carry on the robbery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0248.wav|with Ostend tickets previously procured, returned to London without mishap, and by degrees disposed of much of the stolen gold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0250.wav|and the theft might have remained a mystery but for the subsequent bad faith of Pierce to his accomplice Agar.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0251.wav|The latter was ere long arrested on a charge of uttering forged cheques, convicted, and sentenced to transportation for life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0254.wav|together with the unrealized part of the bullion, amounting in all to some fifteen thousand pounds,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0258.wav|went to the police in great fury and distress, and disclosed all she knew of the affair.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0260.wav|As the evidence he gave incriminated Pierce, Burgess, and Tester, all three were arrested and committed to Newgate for trial.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0262.wav|came out at the Old Bailey, and was acknowledged to be one of the most extraordinary on record.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0264.wav|The series of boldly-conceived and cleverly-executed forgeries in which James Townshend Saward, commonly called "Jem the Penman,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0265.wav|was the prime mover,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0266.wav|has probably no parallel in the annals of crime. Saward himself is a striking and in some respects an unique figure in criminal history.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0267.wav|A man of birth and education, a member of the bar, and of acknowledged legal attainments, his proclivities were all downward.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0270.wav|cheques and bills, of which he made a particular use.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0271.wav|He dealt too in the precious metals, when they had been improperly acquired,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0273.wav|But Saward's operations were mainly directed to the fabrication and uttering of forged cheques.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0274.wav|His method was comprehensive and deeply laid.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0275.wav|Burglars brought him the cheques they stole from houses, thieves what they got in pocketbooks.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0276.wav|Cheques blank and canceled were his stock-in-trade. The former he filled up by exact imitation of the latter, signature and all.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0277.wav|When he could get nothing but the blank cheque, he set in motion all sorts of schemes for obtaining signatures, such as
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0278.wav|commencing sham actions, and addressing formal applications, merely for the reply.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0279.wav|One stroke of luck which he turned to great account
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0283.wav|The bearer of the cheque was always innocent and ignorant of the fraudulent nature of the document he presented.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0287.wav|not only to ensure fair play and the surrender of the proceeds if the cheque was cashed, but to give timely notice if it was not,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0288.wav|so that Saward and the rest might make themselves scarce.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0290.wav|the forgers always escaped detection. But fate overtook two of the gang,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0291.wav|partly through their own carelessness, when transferring their operations to Yarmouth.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0293.wav|as coming from a Mr. Whitney.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0294.wav|He forgot to add that it was to be placed to Ralph's credit, and when he called as Ralph,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0296.wav|Hardwicke, or "Ralph," appealed to Saward in his difficulty
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0300.wav|Saward's letter to Hardwicke fell into the hands of the police and compromised him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0301.wav|While Hardwicke and Atwell were in Newgate awaiting trial, active search was made for Saward,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0303.wav|but on being searched, two blank cheques of the London and Westminster Bank were found in his pocket.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0305.wav|At his trial Atwell and Hardwicke, two of his chief allies and accomplices, turned approvers,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0004.wav|Yet the jail, in spite of its fortress-like aspect, was by no means really safe.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0005.wav|Year after year prisoners determined to get free, and occasionally succeeded in their efforts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0007.wav|There were others less successful.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0008.wav|Charles Thomas White, awaiting execution for arson, made a desperate effort to escape from Newgate in eighteen twenty-seven.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0009.wav|He had friends and auxiliaries inside the jail and out. The cell he occupied was near the outer wall,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0011.wav|The ladder was actually made, of black sewing-thread firmly and closely interwoven. But White could not remove the bars;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0012.wav|the instruments needed for the purpose never reached him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0013.wav|It was noticed that he was most anxious to receive a pair of shoes for which he had asked, and when they arrived they were closely examined.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0014.wav|Sewn in between the upper and lower leathers several spring saws were found, which would have easily cut through any bars.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0015.wav|White, when taxed with his attempt, admitted that the accusation was true, and spoke "with pride and satisfaction of the practicability of his scheme."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0019.wav|and climbed up the pipe of a cistern in the corner of the press yard; some thought with the idea of drowning himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0020.wav|He never reached the cistern, but fell back into the yard, injuring his legs severely.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0027.wav|Escape seemed absolutely hopeless,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0030.wav|they preferred to credit it to carelessness or collusion from officers of the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0032.wav|Williams as a capital convict was lodged in the press-yard or condemned ward.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0033.wav|He had access to the airing yard, and there was for hours no kind of supervision.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0035.wav|the wall beneath and above it was "rusticated," in other words, the granite surface had become roughened, and offered a sort of foothold.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0039.wav|Williams surveyed these formidable obstacles to evasion, and calmly proceeded to surmount them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0040.wav|His first task was to gain the top of the cistern; this he effected by keeping his back to one side of the angle,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0043.wav|The least slip now would have been fatal to him. But he could not thrust his body in through the narrow space left by the chevaux-de-frise,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0046.wav|the spikes of the railing penetrated his flesh and made progression slow and difficult.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0047.wav|But the worst part of the business was to jump from this irksome foothold of the iron grating on to the top of the building just mentioned,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0048.wav|a distance of eight or nine feet.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0049.wav|He had here completed his ascent.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0050.wav|His next job was to descend outside Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0051.wav|Clambering along the roof,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0052.wav|he passed to the top of the ordinary's residence, hoping to find an open sky-light by which he might enter and so work downstairs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0053.wav|If the worst came to the worst, he intended to have gone down some chimney, as he had often done before in the way of business.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0054.wav|But he did not like the risk of entering a room by the fireplace, and the chances of detection it offered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0055.wav|He traversed vainly all the roofs in Newgate Street,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0065.wav|To walk out into the street was an easy affair, and he was now free, with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0066.wav|Denied admission everywhere as a ragged, half-naked beggar,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0070.wav|from a widow woman, who gave him "bub and grub," or food and one-and-sixpence, for every nine days' work.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0073.wav|Mr. Cope, the governor of Newgate, having been communicated with, proceeded to Winchester, where he at once identified Williams.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0075.wav|It was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hopes of escaping by the flue.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0077.wav|A man named Lears, under sentence of transportation for an attempt at murder on board ship, got up part of the way,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0079.wav|Lears was rewarded by being obliged to wear cross irons on his legs, a punishment rarely inflicted in Newgate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0080.wav|and probably one of the few cases of a recurrence, but under proper safeguards and limitations, to the old system of chains.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0082.wav|The ward was one short of its number. What had become of the fellow?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0085.wav|After this great iron guards, just as are to be seen in lunatic asylums,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0087.wav|Among the escapes still remembered was one in eighteen forty-nine, accomplished by a man who had been employed
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0091.wav|This was a public-house.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0102.wav|By evening he manufactured a good long length,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0103.wav|and after all was quiet the three got on to the roof through the hole, and so on to Tyler's manufactory close by,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0108.wav|The Newgate officers obtained information of this, and went to the spot, where they effected the capture,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0110.wav|The third, Bell, remained longest at large. He too was run into at a lodging in the Kingsland Road.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0112.wav|All three after recapture passed on, as originally intended, to Leicester, where they did their "bit" and were released;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0113.wav|but only to be taken soon afterwards for a fresh offense, and again pass through Newgate with sentences of penal servitude.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0115.wav|A sailor, Krapps by name, occupied one of the upper cells in the new block.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0116.wav|The doors, through incomplete knowledge of prison needs, were not, as now, sheeted with iron.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0117.wav|The prisoner had nothing to deal with but wooden panels, and by dint of cutting and chopping he got both the lower panels out.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0119.wav|Under superior orders all the doors and gates of this block were left open at night, to allow the night watchman to pass freely to all parts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0120.wav|This was considered safer than intrusting him with keys.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0122.wav|He made a strong rope with several of the sheets; then, returning to the male yard,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0123.wav|got hold of the step ladder used in lighting the gas, and which under our more careful supervision would have been, as now-a-days, chained up.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0124.wav|Cutting the cord which fastened the two legs of the step ladder, he opened them out and made one long length;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0125.wav|with this, placed against the wall near the chevaux-de-frise, he made an escalade.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0127.wav|Along this Krapps crawled, and then dropped down on to the cook-house.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0128.wav|He now put in requisition the rope made of the sheets, and with its help lowered himself into the street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0133.wav|There is, however, no explanation of the motives which prompt prisoners to attempt escapes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0136.wav|On the other hand, at the great convict establishments, such is the moral restraint of a systematic discipline,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0138.wav|at a distance from the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0139.wav|The last escape from Newgate was only three years ago, and occurred just before the final closing of the prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0140.wav|No report of it was made public, as the man was almost immediately recaptured.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0141.wav|He was at work under the supervision of the artisan warder of the prison,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0143.wav|He was out of sight while so employed, and remained so long absent that the warder, becoming uneasy, went in search of him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0145.wav|Encouraged by the shouts and signals of some workmen employed on a building outside, the prisoner made one of the most marvellous jumps on record,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0146.wav|from the building he was on to a distant wall, with a drop of sixty feet between.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0147.wav|Then he ran along the coping of the wall towards its angle with Tyler's manufactory, and dropped down on to the gridiron below.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0149.wav|Suicides and executions were, however, always the most effectual methods of making exit from durance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0153.wav|would make death a certainty, so limited and imperfect are the means generally available.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0154.wav|When a bit of rope carefully secreted,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0156.wav|at no elevation affords the only drop, strangulation would seldom supervene but for the resolution of the miserable felo de se.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0159.wav|who contrived to hang himself from a hammock hook only eighteen inches from the ground.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0160.wav|The noose was one of his hammock straps, which he buckled round his throat.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0161.wav|Having carefully spread out a blanket on the floor just below the hammock as it lay suspended,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0163.wav|He might have saved himself at any moment by merely extending an arm; but he lay there patiently till death supervened.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0164.wav|When discovered next morning, quite dead, it was found that the strap actually did not touch his throat;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0165.wav|three fingers might have been inserted between it and the flesh; the pressure was all on the arteries behind the ears,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0167.wav|Probably dissolution came as easily and almost without pain.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0168.wav|A laudable desire to invest executions with more and more solemnity and decorum gained ground as they became more rare.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0169.wav|As more humane principles were introduced into prison management,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0172.wav|There were still untoward accidents occasionally at executions, and even the chief practitioner of recent times, Calcraft,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0176.wav|After Calcraft's resignation no successor was really appointed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0180.wav|But Calcraft regularly succeeded Foxen, who followed Botting, and Dennis, the actor in the seventeen eighty riots.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0181.wav|Calcraft was born at Baddow, in Essex, in eighteen hundred;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0183.wav|The story goes, that about eighteen twenty-eight
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0184.wav|his attention was drawn early one morning to a man who leant against a lamp-post in Finsbury Square, coughing violently.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0185.wav|Calcraft, who, in spite of the dreadful calling he subsequently followed, was always reputed a kindly man,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0186.wav|invited the man with the cough to enter a neighboring house and try a little peppermint for it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0187.wav|The other accepted, and they got into conversation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0188.wav|He told Calcraft that he was Foxen the executioner, and that he was that moment on his way to Newgate to hang a man,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0189.wav|but that his cough was getting so much the master of him that he feared he would not be able to carry on his duties much longer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0191.wav|was given to drink, and not to be trusted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0197.wav|After that he worked alone.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0198.wav|I cannot find that Calcraft was sworn in when appointed, or any exact information when the old forbidding ceremony ceased to be practiced.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0201.wav|When he had taken the oath he was dismissed with the words, "Get thee hence, wretch!"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0203.wav|He got besides half-a-crown for every man he flogged, and an allowance to provide cats or birch rods.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0206.wav|he was also at liberty to engage himself in the country, where he demanded and was paid ten pounds on each occasion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0208.wav|The onus and responsibility of carrying out the sentence is personal to the sheriff. A good story is told illustrating this.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0211.wav|But, fortunately for him, just at the last moment Calcraft was set free.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0213.wav|The origin of this expression dates, it is said, from the time when the Scottish mark,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0214.wav|a silver coin bearing the same relation to the Scottish pound that an English shilling does to an English pound, was made to pass current in England.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0217.wav|On one particular occasion, however, he got them. A gentleman whose sins brought him to the gallows at Maidstone
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0218.wav|wished to do Calcraft a good turn, and sent to his London tailor for a complete new suit, in which he appeared at his execution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0220.wav|On another occasion an importunate person begged Calcraft eagerly to claim his right to the clothes, and give them to him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0222.wav|It may be added that of late years the clothes in which a convict has suffered are invariably burnt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0224.wav|Calcraft shared the odium which his office, not strangely, has always inspired. But he was admitted into the jail,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0227.wav|whose business it was to provide the rope and do the pinioning, and who was paid a fee of five shillings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0228.wav|They did not dislike Calcraft, however, at Newgate. He was an illiterate, simple-minded man, who scarcely remembered what executions he had performed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0230.wav|His nature must have been kindly.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0231.wav|When he came to the prison for his wages his grandchildren often accompanied him, affectionately clinging to his hands;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0232.wav|and he owned a pet pony which would follow him about like a dog.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0233.wav|In his own profession
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0235.wav|He was so much in favor of short drops that his immediate successor, Marwood, stigmatized him as "short-drop" man.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0236.wav|Marwood being, on the other hand, in favor of giving a man as much rope as possible.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0237.wav|With Calcraft's method there were undoubtedly many failures, and it was a common custom for him to go below the gallows
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0238.wav|"just to steady their legs a little;" in other words, to add his weight to that of the hanging bodies.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0244.wav|who first took to the work from predilection, and the idea of being useful in his generation, as he himself assured the writer of these pages.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0245.wav|Until the time of his death he kept a small shop close to the church in Horncastle.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0251.wav|and must be strongly deprecated on moral grounds, as tending to the utter degradation of one individual.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0252.wav|Possibly such changes may be introduced into the method of execution
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0258.wav|This line of argument prevailed over the manifest horrors of the spectacle. These increased as time passed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0259.wav|The graphic and terrible account given by Charles Dickens of the awful scene before Horsemonger Lane Jail, at the execution of the Mannings,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0260.wav|has already been quoted. Again, the concourse of people collected in front of Newgate to witness the execution,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0261.wav|simultaneously, of the five pirates, part of the mutinous crew of the 'Flowery Land,' was greater than on any previous occasion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0262.wav|It was a callous, careless crowd of coarse-minded, semi-brutalized folk, who came to enjoy themselves.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0265.wav|the crowd had come to witness a popular and gratuitous public performance -- better than a prize-fight or a play.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0266.wav|No notion that they were assisting at a vindication of the law filled the minds of those present with dread.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0267.wav|On the contrary, the prevailing sentiment was one of satisfaction at the success of the spectacle.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0271.wav|The reply evinced equal satisfaction, and the speaker, with a profane oath, declared that he would like to act as Jack Ketch to the whole lot.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0272.wav|To the disgrace of the better-educated and better-bred public, executions could still command the attendance of curious aristocrats from the West End.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0275.wav|As much as twenty-five pounds was paid for a first-floor front on this occasion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0278.wav|and which contributed in no small degree to the introduction of private executions. A great crowd was expected, and a great crowd came.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0279.wav|They collected over night in the bright light of a November moon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0280.wav|"There were well-dressed and ill-dressed, old men and lads, women and girls."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0281.wav|Rain fell heavily at intervals, but did not thin the concourse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0283.wav|to do them mere justice, there was at least till then a half-drunken ribald gaiety among the crowd that made them all akin."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0285.wav|Then one struck up the hymn of the Promised Land, and the refrain was at once taken up with a mighty chorus --
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0289.wav|As day broke the character of the crowd was betrayed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0290.wav|There were but few women, except of the most degraded sort; the men were mostly young men --
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0292.wav|bricklayers' laborers, dock workmen, German artisans and sugar-bakers
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0295.wav|curse, or shout, as in this heaving and struggling forward they gained or lost in their strong efforts to get nearer where Müller was to die.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0299.wav|robbery and violence, loud laughing, oaths, fighting, obscene conduct, and still more filthy language reigned round the gallows far and near.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0300.wav|Such too the scene remained with little change or respite till the old hangman (Calcraft) slunk again along the drop,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0301.wav|amid hisses and sneering inquiries of what he had had to drink that morning.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0303.wav|It was preposterous to claim for such a scene as this that it conveyed any great moral lesson, or had any deterring influence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0307.wav|Full evidence was taken on all points, and on that regarding public executions there was a great preponderance of opinion towards their abolition,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0308.wav|yet the witnesses were not unanimous.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0309.wav|Some of the judges would have retained the public spectacle; the ordinary of Newgate was not certain that public executions were not the best.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0310.wav|Another distinguished witness feared
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0312.wav|Foreign witnesses, too, were in favor of publicity.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0313.wav|On the other hand, Lords Cranworth and Wensleydale recommended private executions; so did Mr. Spencer Walpole, M.P.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0314.wav|Sir George Grey thought there was a growing feeling in favor of executions within the prison precincts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0316.wav|based on his experience of them in Western Australia. He not only thought them likely to be more deterrent,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0318.wav|Other officials, great lawyers, governors of prisons, and chaplains supported this view.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0320.wav|But these, it was thought, might be provided by the admission of the press and the holding of a coroner's inquest.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0325.wav|The judge of the Admiralty Court, the Right Hon. Stephen Lushington, the Right Hon. James Moncrieff,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0327.wav|declared that they were not prepared to agree to the resolution respecting private executions.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0331.wav|The last public execution in front of Newgate was that of the Fenian Michael Barrett,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0333.wav|from Clerkenwell prison, by which many persons lost their lives.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0334.wav|Unusual precautions were taken upon this occasion, as some fresh outrage was apprehended.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0340.wav|and Calcraft, who had been threatened with summary retribution if he executed Barrett, carried out the sentence without mishap.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0342.wav|The first private execution under the new law took place within the precincts of Maidstone Jail.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0059.wav|even after sentence, and until within a few hours of execution, he was buoyed up with the hope of reprieve.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0060.wav|The conviction that he would escape had taken so firm a hold of him,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0068.wav|and public opinion at the termination of the trial coincided with the verdict of the jury.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0071.wav|To meet his liabilities, he raised large sums on forged bills of acceptance drawn upon his mother, a woman of some means,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0073.wav|In eighteen fifty-four he owed a very large sum of money, but he was temporarily relieved by the death of his wife,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0074.wav|whose life he had insured for thirteen thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0075.wav|There is every reason to suppose that he poisoned his wife to obtain possession of this sum upon her death.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0085.wav|Palmer's plan was to administer poison in quantities insufficient to cause death, but enough to produce illness which would account for death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0086.wav|For this purpose he gave, or there was the strongest presumption that he gave,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0087.wav|antimony, which caused Cook's constant sickness.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0088.wav|Quantities of antimony were found in the body after death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0090.wav|and so got the money for which he was prepared to barter his soul.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0096.wav|The night he bought it, Cook, who had been taking certain pills under medical advice, not Palmer's, was seized with violent convulsions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0097.wav|He had swallowed his pills as usual, at least Palmer had administered them

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0102.wav|The second attack was fatal, and ended in Cook's death from tetanus.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0103.wav|This tetanus, according to the prosecution, was produced by strychnia, and followed the administration of pills by Palmer

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0110.wav|He said nothing, but began to feel uneasy when he found that Cook's betting-book was missing, and that Palmer put it forward
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0117.wav|The examination of the stomach betrayed the presence of antimony in large quantities, but no strychnia,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0119.wav|All the circumstances were so suspicious that he could not escape the criminal charge.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0120.wav|He had already been arrested on a writ issued at the instance of the money-lenders, and an action had been commenced against Mrs. Palmer on her acceptances.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0121.wav|It came out at once that these had been forged, and the whole affair at once took the ugliest complexion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0122.wav|A government prosecution was instituted, and Palmer was brought to Newgate for trial at the Central Criminal Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0126.wav|He relied on the absence of the strychnia.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0127.wav|But the chain of circumstantial evidence was strong enough to satisfy the jury, who agreed to their verdict in an hour.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0128.wav|At the last moment Palmer tossed a bit of paper over to his counsel, on which he had written, quote, I think there will be a verdict of Not Guilty, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0134.wav|Within a few weeks occurred the Leeds poisoning case, in which the murderer undoubtedly was inspired by the facts made public at Palmer's trial.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0139.wav|presenting still greater features of resemblance with Palmer's, for both were medical men, and both raised difficult questions of medical jurisprudence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0141.wav|could not divest his mind of serious doubt, and of which the murderer got the benefit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0143.wav|which followed close on its heels, although in that the verdict of "Not Guilty" was excusable, as the evidence was entirely circumstantial.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0144.wav|There was no convincing proof that the accused had administered the poison, although beyond question that poison had occasioned the death.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0160.wav|as indicating a motive for keeping her alive rather than killing her.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0164.wav|with the idea of subjecting her to the irritant poison slowly but surely until the desired effect, death, was achieved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0165.wav|As she became worse and worse, Smethurst called in the best medical advice in Richmond,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0166.wav|but was careful to prime them with his facts and lead them if possible to accept his diagnosis of the case.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0238.wav|Taffir, the second mate, agreed, but constantly went in fear of his life for the remainder of the voyage;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0240.wav|Immediately after the murder cases of champagne, which formed part of the cargo, were brought on deck and broached;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0244.wav|The murders were perpetrated on the tenth September, and the ship continued her voyage for nearly three weeks, meeting and speaking one ship only.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0245.wav|On the second October they sighted land, ten miles distant;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0246.wav|the mutineers took command of the ship, put her about till night-fall, by which time they had scuttled her, got out the boats, and all left the ship.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0247.wav|The rest of the crew were also permitted to embark, except the Chinamen, one of whom was thrown into the water and drowned,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0252.wav|The place at which they landed was not far from the entrance to the River Plate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0253.wav|A farmer took them in for the night, and drove them next day to Rocha, a place north of Maldonado.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0259.wav|Eight were arraigned at the same time: six Spaniards, Leon, Blanco, Duranno, Santos, and Marsolino;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0262.wav|Two of the seven, Santos and Marsolino, were reprieved, and their sentences commuted to penal servitude for life;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0263.wav|the remaining five were executed in one batch.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0264.wav|They were an abject, miserable crew, cowards at heart; but some, especially Lopez, continued bloodthirsty to the last.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0266.wav|They none of them spoke much English except Leon, commonly called Lyons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0267.wav|After condemnation, as the rules now kept capital convicts strictly apart, they could not be lodged in the two condemned cells,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0268.wav|and they were each kept in an ordinary separate cell of the newly-constructed block, with the "traps," or square openings in the cell door,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0273.wav|Lopez was more talkative.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0274.wav|When the warder went in to call him he asked for his clothes. He was told he would have to wear his own.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0276.wav|Then he wanted to know when the policemen would arrive, and was told none would come.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0278.wav|No soldiers either.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0280.wav|The convicts were pinioned one by one and sent singly out to the gallows.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0281.wav|As the first to appear would have some time to wait for his fellows, a difficult and painful ordeal,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0283.wav|This was Duranno; but the sight of the heaving mass of uplifted, impassioned faces
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0284.wav|was too much for his nerves, and he so nearly fainted that he had to be seated in a chair.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0002.wav|In July eighteen sixty-four occurred the murder of Mr. Briggs, a gentleman advanced in years and chief clerk in Robarts' bank.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0003.wav|As the circumstances under which it was perpetrated were somewhat novel,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0004.wav|and as some time elapsed before the discovery and apprehension of the supposed murderer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0005.wav|the public mind was greatly agitated by the affair for several months. The story of the murder must be pretty familiar to most of my readers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0006.wav|Mr. Briggs left the bank one afternoon as usual, dined with his daughter at Peckham,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0008.wav|He lived at Hackney, but he never reached it alive.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0009.wav|When the train arrived at Hackney station, a passenger who was about to enter one of the carriages found the cushions soaked with blood.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0011.wav|About the same time a body was discovered on the line near the railway-bridge by Victoria Park.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0012.wav|It was that of an aged man, whose head had been battered in by a life-preserver.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0015.wav|His identity was established by a bundle of letters in his pocket, which bore his full address:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0017.wav|The friends of Mr. Briggs were communicated with, and it was ascertained that when he left home the morning of the murderous attack,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0018.wav|he wore gold-rimmed eye-glasses and a gold watch and chain.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0019.wav|The stick and bag were his, but not the hat.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0020.wav|A desperate and deadly struggle must have taken place in the carriage, and the stain of a bloody hand marked the door.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0021.wav|The facts of the murder and its object, robbery, were thus conclusively proved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0024.wav|Mr. Death, who had given another in exchange for it to a man supposed to be a foreigner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0026.wav|showed how greatly the publicity and wide dissemination of the news regarding murder facilitate the detection of crime.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0028.wav|who had been a lodger of his. Müller had given the cabman's little daughter a jeweler's cardboard box bearing the name of Mr. Death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0029.wav|A photograph of Müller shown the jeweler was identified as the likeness of the man who had exchanged Mr. Briggs' chain.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0030.wav|Last of all, the cabman swore that he had bought the very hat found in the carriage for Müller at the hatter's, Walker's of Crawford Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0032.wav|There was no mystery about his departure; he had gone to Canada, by the 'Victoria' sailing ship, starting from the London docks, and bound to New York.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0033.wav|Directly the foregoing facts were established, a couple of detective officers, armed with a warrant to arrest Müller,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0034.wav|and accompanied by Mr. Death the jeweler and the cabman, went down to Liverpool and took the first steamer across the Atlantic.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0036.wav|The officers went on board the 'Victoria' at once, Müller was identified by Mr. Death, and the arrest was made.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0037.wav|In searching the prisoner's box, Mr. Briggs' watch was found wrapped up in a piece of leather,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0038.wav|and Müller at the time of his capture was actually wearing Mr. Briggs' hat, cut down and somewhat altered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0039.wav|The prisoner was forthwith extradited and sent back to England, which he reached with his escort on the seventeenth September the same year.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0040.wav|His trial followed at the next sessions of the Central Criminal Court, and ended in his conviction.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0044.wav|There was the prisoner's poverty, his inability to account for himself on the night of the murder, and his possession of the property of the murdered man.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0046.wav|Müller protested after sentence of death had been passed upon him that he had been convicted on a false statement of facts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0048.wav|and powerful influence was exerted both here and abroad to obtain a reprieve.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0065.wav|At the disbandment of the force, as he was without resources, he turned his attention to hotel robberies, by which he lived for some years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0066.wav|He at length stole a carpet-bag containing valuables, and fled to Hamburgh.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0070.wav|Sattler was ironed for safe custody,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0071.wav|a proceeding which he vehemently resented, and begged that they might be removed, as the handcuffs hurt his wrists.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0072.wav|The inspector said that they could not be removed till he reached England.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0074.wav|Sattler probably misunderstood, and he declared that the police officer had broken faith with him, having, moreover, stated that
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0075.wav|while at sea the captain of the ship was responsible for the security of the prisoner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0077.wav|Although manacled, he managed to get a pistol from his chest and load it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0078.wav|The next time Thain entered his cabin he fired at him point-blank, and lodged three bullets in his breast.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0080.wav|Sattler was tried for murder and convicted;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0081.wav|his defense being that he had intended to commit suicide, but that, on the appearance of this officer who had wronged him,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0083.wav|Sattler was a very excitable although not an ill-tempered man.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0084.wav|While in Newgate awaiting trial he frequently tried to justify his murder by declaring that the police officer had broken faith with him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0087.wav|Several cases of gigantic fraud, rivaling any already recorded, were brought to light between eighteen fifty-six and eighteen seventy-three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0089.wav|Another case of long-continued successful forgery was brought to light two years after the convictions of Saward and his accomplices.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0090.wav|This conspiracy was cleverly planned, but had scarcely so many ramifications as that of Saward. Its originators were a couple of men,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0094.wav|Forged cheques and bills were soon uttered in great numbers, as well as base coin.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0095.wav|The police suspecting the house in York Buildings, put a watch on the premises, which they kept up for more than a year,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0096.wav|and thus obtained personal knowledge of all who passed in and out, but without obtaining any direct evidence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0100.wav|took to appropriating the bills intrusted to him, and so lost his business, after which he became a clerk to Messrs. Wagner and Bateman.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0103.wav|and silver coins, with all the latest appliances for coining, including those of electroplating;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0108.wav|His copies were generally pronounced indistinguishable from and as good as the originals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0110.wav|Much the same plan was adopted by these forgers as by Saward to get their cheques cashed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0113.wav|The principals in this conspiracy, Wagner and Bateman, were sentenced to penal servitude for life,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0115.wav|It was stated in evidence that the monies obtained by these forgeries amounted to eight thousand pounds or ten thousand pounds,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0120.wav|A more elaborate plot in many ways, more secretly, more patiently prepared than the preceding, or indeed than any in the calendar,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0121.wav|was the case of the forgeries upon the Bank of England discovered in eighteen sixty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0123.wav|a man named Burnett came with his wife and took up his residence at Whitchurch, Hampshire, at no great distance from Laverstock,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0128.wav|Brown took several sheets, and then was detected by Brewer, a fellow-workman of superior grade,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0129.wav|who threatened to betray the theft. But Brewer, either before or after this, succumbed to temptation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0133.wav|which gave him access to all parts of the mills, the packing-room included.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0135.wav|and in the states known as "water-leaf" and "sized," which are the penultimate processes of manufacture.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0141.wav|led to the employment of the police, and the offer of a reward of fifteen hundred pounds for the detection of the offenders.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0144.wav|The amount of Brewer's abstractions (who was eventually acquitted) was never exactly estimated.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0147.wav|The next step was to take the principals, and under such circumstances as would insure their conviction.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0148.wav|A watch was set on Burnett, who was followed to the shop of one Buncher, a butcher in Strutton Ground.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0152.wav|With her assistance on a certain day a couple of bricks were taken out of the wall dividing her front and back parlors;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0154.wav|He came to complete a sale of forged notes, and he wanted a couple of hundred pounds for what he had.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0155.wav|Mrs. Campbell offered him less, and there was an altercation, in the course of which Buncher became very violent, and at length,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0157.wav|In the course of his remarks, however, he said,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0158.wav|I am the man that has got all the bank paper; I have thirty thousand pounds now, and the Bank of England cannot stop it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0161.wav|They also discovered that through the intermediacy of one Robert Cummings, well known as a reputed coiner,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0163.wav|Griffiths was an unusually clever and skilful workman,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0164.wav|who had devoted all his talent and all his energies for some seventeen years to the fabrication of false bank-notes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0165.wav|On a certain day, the twenty-seventh October, eighteen sixty-two, the two were arrested simultaneously;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0168.wav|but proofs of Griffiths' guilt were at once apparent on entering his work-room.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0169.wav|In one corner was a printing-press actually in use, and on it were twenty-one forged Bank of England notes, without date or signature.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0170.wav|On the bed were twenty forged ten-pound notes complete and ready for use, and twenty-five five-pound notes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0173.wav|Griffiths afterwards admitted that he had been employed in defrauding the bank since eighteen forty-six,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0174.wav|and the prominent part he played secured for him on conviction the heaviest sentence of the law.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0176.wav|Cummings, who had introduced Buncher to Griffiths, was also tried for being in possession of stolen bank paper for improper purposes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0180.wav|But he was not long at large; he was too active an evil-doer
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0181.wav|and was perpetually in trouble. Commencing life as a resurrection man, when that trade failed through the change in the law,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0183.wav|he devoted his energies to coining and forgery, and in the latter line was a friend and associate of Saward's.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0184.wav|One narrow escape he had, however, before he abandoned his old business.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0190.wav|"By all means," replies Bob, and a close investigation follows, without any detection of the corpse concealed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0193.wav|With the police officers it had passed muster as a living member of the party.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0198.wav|It is told of "Bob" Brennan, an official specially employed for years by the Mint
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0199.wav|to watch and prosecute coiners, that he received information that coining was carried on by Cummings and others at a place in Westminster.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0202.wav|But the police nearly paid the penalty of capture with their lives.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0056.wav|Colonel Jebb preferred it; Messrs. Crawford and Whitworth Russell were convinced that the complete isolation of criminals from one another
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0058.wav|Prison chaplains of experience and high repute, such as Messrs. Field, Clay, Kingsmill, Burt, and Osborne, also advocated it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0059.wav|It was claimed for it that it was more deterrent;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0060.wav|that in districts where it was the rule, evil-doers especially dreaded coming under its irksome conditions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0062.wav|The system of associated labor in silence had also its warm supporters,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0063.wav|who maintained that under this system prisoners were more industrious and more healthy

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0076.wav|This variety was often extended to all branches of prison economy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0077.wav|There was an absolute want of uniformity in dietaries; in some prisons it was too liberal, in others too low.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0078.wav|The amount of exercise varied from one or two hours daily to half the working day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0079.wav|The cells inhabited by prisoners were of very varying dimensions;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0081.wav|The use of gas or some other means of lighting might be adopted, but more often was dispensed with.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0082.wav|In a great number of prisons no provision was made for the education of prisoners, in some others there was a sufficient staff of schoolmasters and instructors.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0095.wav|which was yet under full control, and might be made to work corn-mills or prove otherwise productive;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0096.wav|other authorities as strongly condemned it as brutalizing, unequal in its operation, and altogether a "deplorable invention."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0100.wav|but the session was far advanced, and the matter was relegated to the following year.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0102.wav|which was promptly carried, with the additional instruction to the committee to suggest any improvements.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0105.wav|and that a new system of prison discipline should be introduced.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0106.wav|His plan was to devote the whole labor of prisoners sentenced to any term between three months and four years to agriculture.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0107.wav|District prisons were to be established for this purpose, each of which would be in the heart of a farm of a thousand acres.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0109.wav|Mr. Pearson backed up his recommendations by many sound arguments.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0110.wav|Field labor, he urged, and with reason, was a very suitable employment;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0113.wav|The scheme was no doubt fascinating, and in many respects feasible;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0115.wav|In his proposal he dwelt much upon the humanizing effects of healthful open-air toil,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0118.wav|and later experience has fully proved the advantage of a judicious system of gratuities for labor;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0120.wav|omitted the fact that he might have to deal with that persistent idleness which is not an unknown characteristic of the criminal class.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0121.wav|The hope of reward might do much, but no system of penal discipline is complete unless it can also count upon the fear of punishment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0124.wav|thinking perhaps that prisoners so well disposed would cheerfully remain in jail of their own accord.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0125.wav|But an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape, which some at least would have attempted, probably with success.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0129.wav|which marked the growth of public interest in prison affairs, and which was the germ of the new system
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0131.wav|Mr. Pearson and the committee of eighteen fifty have the more claim on our consideration, because,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0133.wav|The condition of that prison in eighteen fifty may be gathered from the pages of the report. Not much had been done to remedy the old defects;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0135.wav|There was no longer, or at worst but rarely, and for short periods, the same overcrowding.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0136.wav|This was obviated by the frequent sessions of the Central Criminal Court, and the utilization of the two subsidiary prisons in Giltspur Street and Southwark.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0142.wav|now seldom contained more than ten or a dozen each. Some sort of decorum was maintained among the occupants in the day-time.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0144.wav|the indiscriminate visitation of friends, and the almost unlimited admission of extra food, these more glaring defects had disappeared.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0146.wav|There was as yet no control over the prisoners after locking-up time;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0148.wav|The prisoners were still left to themselves till next morning's unlocking,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0149.wav|and they spent some fourteen or fifteen hours in total darkness, and almost without check or control.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0154.wav|If any disturbance reached his ears, he reported the case to the governor, who next morning visited the ward in fault, and asked for the culprit.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0155.wav|The enforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0161.wav|These disciplinary improvements were, however, only slowly and gradually introduced.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0163.wav|Thus the wards, which, as I have said, were left in complete darkness, were now to be lighted with gas; and after this most salutary addition,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0166.wav|those for trial, and those sentenced for short terms or long
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0168.wav|Renewed recommendations to provide employment resulted in the provision of a certain amount of oakum for picking,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0169.wav|and one or two men were allowed to mend clothes and make shoes. The rules made by the Secretary of State were hung up in conspicuous parts of the prison;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0170.wav|more officers were appointed, as the time of so many of those already on the staff was monopolized by attendance at the Central Criminal Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0171.wav|Another custom which had led to disorder was abolished;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0172.wav|prisoners who had been acquitted were not permitted to return to the prison to show their joy and receive the congratulations of their unfortunate fellows.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0173.wav|The Corporation seems to have introduced these salutary changes without hesitation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0174.wav|It was less prompt apparently in dealing with structural alterations and improvements.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0175.wav|Well-founded complaints had been made of the want of heating appliances in the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0176.wav|The wards had open fires, but the separate cells were not warmed at all.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0177.wav|A scheme for heating the whole prison with hot-water pipes, after the system now generally adopted elsewhere, was considered,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0178.wav|and abandoned because of the expense. As to the entire reconstruction of Newgate, nothing had been done as yet.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0181.wav|is an interesting document, and shows that even at that date the Government contemplated the erection of a model prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0183.wav|provided it was henceforth used only for untried prisoners, suggested that Newgate should be entirely reconstructed, and the new building adopted as a model.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0185.wav|Lord John, with great fairness, admitted that the whole of this burthen could not be imposed upon the city
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0186.wav|seeing that since the establishment of the Central Criminal Court, Newgate received prisoners for trial from several counties,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0188.wav|He forwarded plans prepared by the inspectors of prisons, not for blind adoption, but as a guide.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0189.wav|This plan was on the principle of cellular separation, a system, according to Lord John Russell, desirable in all prisons,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0193.wav|but as the plan was "confessedly experimental, for the benefit of the country generally, the amount for which the city should be responsible should be distinctly limited
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0194.wav|not to exceed a certain sum to be agreed upon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0197.wav|No doubt wiser counsels prevailed with Lord John Russell,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0199.wav|and the costliness of enlarging it, forbade all idea of entirely reconstructing the jail so as to constitute it a model prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0200.wav|It would be far better to begin at the beginning,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0201.wav|to select a sufficiently spacious piece of ground, and erect a prison which from foundations to roofs should be in conformity with the newest ideas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0209.wav|the situation having been proved by long experience to be salubrious.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0213.wav|Now for the first time the Tuffnell estate in Holloway was mentioned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0214.wav|The Corporation owned lands there covering from nineteen to twenty acres.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0216.wav|Eventually Holloway was decided upon as a site for the new city prison.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0218.wav|The prison was to contain four hundred and four prisoners, and the estimated expenditure was seventy-nine thousand pounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0221.wav|It was intended as far as possible that, except awaiting trial, no prisoner should find himself relegated to Newgate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0224.wav|With the reduction of numbers to be accommodated, there was ample space in Newgate for its reconstruction on the most approved modern lines.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0226.wav|the erection of a wing or large block of cells was commenced within the original walls of the prison, and upon the north or male side.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0227.wav|This block contained one hundred and thirty cells, embracing every modern improvement;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0229.wav|This block was completed in eighteen fifty-nine, after which the hitherto unavoidable and long-continued promiscuous association of prisoners
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0231.wav|and by the following year forty-seven new cells had been built on the most approved plan.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0233.wav|and when it was completed, both sides of the prison were brought into harmony with modern ideas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0234.wav|The old buildings were entirely disused, and the whole of the inmates of Newgate were kept constantly in separate confinement.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0235.wav|With the last re-edification of Newgate, a work executed some seven centuries after the first stone of the old jail was laid,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0237.wav|The Act for private executions led to the erection of the gallows shed in the exercising yard, and at the flank of the passage from the condemned cells.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0243.wav|and thus bring the history of prison discipline down to our own times.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0244.wav|The last inquiry into the condition and management of our jails and houses of correction was that made by the Lords' Committee in eighteen sixty-three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0248.wav|leading to an inequality, uncertainty, and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial results.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0249.wav|The varieties in construction were still very marked.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0250.wav|In many prisons the prisoners were still associated, and, from the want of a sufficient number of cells, the principle of separation was still greatly neglected.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0251.wav|Yet this principle, as the committee pointed out, "must now be accepted as the foundation of prison discipline,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0254.wav|they were frequently below the standard size, and were therefore not certified for occupation as was required by law.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0257.wav|Here the tread-wheel was in use, there cellular cranks, or hard-labor machines.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0258.wav|Both, however, varied greatly in mechanism and in the amount of energy they called forth,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0260.wav|At other prisons "shot-drill," the lifting and carrying of heavy round shot, was the favorite method of inflicting penal labor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0264.wav|and it was decidedly of opinion that in all short sentences the hard labor of the tread-wheel, crank, and so forth should be the invariable rule.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0265.wav|In dietaries, again, the same wide diversity of practice obtained.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0266.wav|The efforts made by Sir James Graham years before to introduce uniformity in this particular had failed of effect.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0267.wav|The Secretary of State's suggested scale of diet had seldom been closely followed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0268.wav|In some places the dietary was too full, in others too meager. Its constituents were not of the most suitable character.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0269.wav|More animal food was given than was necessary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0277.wav|the prisoners should be made to dispense with the use of a mattress, and should sleep on planks.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0279.wav|Clause ninety-two, Schedule one of that act authorized the use of plank beds, which were adopted in many prisons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0283.wav|Beds might well be made hard and their use strictly limited.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0284.wav|According to this committee of eighteen sixty-three, beds in the smaller and most carelessly conducted prisons formed a large element in the life of a prisoner.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0285.wav|In one jail fifteen hours were spent in bed out of the twenty-four. This was in keeping with other grave defects and omissions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0286.wav|The minor borough prisons were the worst blot on the still dark and imperfect system.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0288.wav|In them, according to the committee, the old objectionable practices were still in full force.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0289.wav|There was unrestrained association of untried and convicted, juvenile with adult prisoners, vagrants, misdemeanants, felons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0295.wav|A single officer was the only custodian and disciplinary authority in the jail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0296.wav|Complete idleness was tolerated; there was neither penal labor nor light employment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0299.wav|but in one prison it was such that the prisoners' food was supplied daily from the neighboring inn, and the innkeeper's bill constituted the only accounts kept.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0300.wav|The committee might well suggest the abolition of these jails, or their amalgamation with the larger county establishments in their immediate neighborhood.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0302.wav|In eighteen sixty-two there were in all one hundred and ninety-three jails in England and Wales;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0303.wav|of these, sixty-three gave admittance during the entire year to less than twenty-five prisoners;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0306.wav|while twenty-seven received less than six prisoners, and were in some instances absolutely tenantless.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0307.wav|The result of the recommendation of the committee of eighteen sixty-two was the Prison Act of eighteen sixty-five,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0308.wav|the penultimate of such enactments, many of the provisions of which still remain in force.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0311.wav|The legislature was beginning to overcome its disinclination to interfere actively or authoritatively
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0313.wav|However, it now laid down in plain language and with precise details the requirements of a good jail system.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0314.wav|The separation of prisoners in cells duly certified by the inspectors was insisted upon,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0316.wav|Hard labor of the first and second class was carefully defined.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0317.wav|The former, which consisted principally of the tread-wheel, cranks, capstans, shot-drill,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0319.wav|while the latter, which included various forms of industrial employment,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0323.wav|The law made it imperative that every prison should have a prison chapel, and that daily and Sunday services should be held.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0326.wav|Steps were taken to provide the illiterate with secular instruction.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0327.wav|No less close was the care as regards preservation of health.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0329.wav|every prison was ordered to keep up an infirmary, and the medical supervision was to be strict and continuous.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0330.wav|Dietaries were drawn up for adoption on the recommendation of a committee of experts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0331.wav|Baths were provided, ablutions ordered, and all appliances to insure personal cleanliness.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0333.wav|were elected to inspect the prisons frequently, to examine the prisoners, hear complaints, and check abuses.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0334.wav|Under them the governor or jailer was held strictly responsible.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0335.wav|The books and journals he was to keep were minutely specified, and his constant presence in or near the jail was insisted upon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0338.wav|But discipline was to be maintained if necessary by punishment,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0339.wav|while decency and good order were to be insured by the strict prohibition of gambling and drunkenness.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0346.wav|They might raise funds for this purpose, provided a certificate for the necessity for the new works was given, either by the recorder
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0349.wav|and they met with the approval of his professional adviser, the surveyor-general of prisons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0350.wav|The funds necessary would be advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, and the interest might be charged against the county or borough rates.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0362.wav|Where the local authority had neglected to comply with the provisions of the eighteen sixty-five Act for four consecutive years,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0364.wav|His order would at the same time specify some neighboring and more satisfactory prison which the local authority would be compelled to utilize instead,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0367.wav|and with the warning a copy of the particular defects and allegations was to be sent to the local authority.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0368.wav|The latter too was to be laid before the House of Commons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0372.wav|It was practically inoperative as regards the penalties for neglect. It was no doubt as irksome and inconvenient to the Secretary of State
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0373.wav|to avail himself of his powers, as it was difficult to bring home the derelictions of duties and evasion of the acts. Too much was left to the inspectors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0375.wav|There were only two of them, and they could not visit each prison more than once in each year, sometimes not oftener than once in eighteen months.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0381.wav|in another there was half-heartedness, even apathy and an almost complete contempt for the provisions of the act.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0386.wav|that no complete reform could be accomplished so long as the prisons were left under the jurisdiction of the local authorities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0388.wav|This bill, reintroduced in eighteen seventy-seven, became law that year, after which the whole of the prisons, including Newgate,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0389.wav|passed under the more direct control of the State.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0390.wav|Since then a strong central authority has labored steadfastly to compass concentration,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0391.wav|to close useless prisons, and to insure that uniformity of system which all thoughtful persons had long admitted to be of paramount importance
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0392.wav|in the administration of prisons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0393.wav|Three years after the advent of the prison commissioners, it was decided that Newgate was an excessively costly and redundant establishment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0394.wav|It was only filled at the periods when the sessions of the Central Criminal Court were in progress;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0395.wav|at others an expensive staff was maintained with little or nothing to do.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0396.wav|At a short distance stood another prison of detention, that of Clerkenwell,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0397.wav|with spare accommodation sufficient to receive all prisoners who were then committed to Newgate. These arguments were unanswerable.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0399.wav|and it is now, except during sessions or when the gallows is in requisition, practically and for ever closed.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0170.wav|complain that all we have done is unnecessary and subject to great risks.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0172.wav|They point to England.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0175.wav|but I do not believe any intelligent observer can accuse England of undue orthodoxy in the present emergency.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0187.wav|It is perhaps not strange that the conservative British press has told us with pardonable irony
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0188.wav|that much of our New Deal program is only an attempt to catch up with English reforms that go back ten years or more.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0004.wav|In the many weeks since that time the Congress has devoted itself to the arduous task of formulating legislation necessary to the country's welfare.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0005.wav|It has made and is making distinct progress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0006.wav|Before I come to any of the specific measures, however, I want to leave in your minds one clear fact.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0009.wav|The job of creating a program for the nation's welfare is, in some respects, like the building of a ship.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0011.wav|When one of these ships is under construction and the steel frames have been set in the keel,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0012.wav|it is difficult for a person who does not know ships to tell how it will finally look when it is sailing the high seas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0014.wav|the creation of a useful instrument for man ultimately comes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0015.wav|It is that way with the making of a national policy. The objective of the nation has greatly changed in three years
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0016.wav|Before that time individual self- interest and group selfishness were paramount in public thinking.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0017.wav|The general good was at a discount.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0018.wav|Three years of hard thinking have changed the picture.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0022.wav|That is a tremendous gain for the principles of democracy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0024.wav|They know that the process of the constructive rebuilding of America cannot be done in a day or a year,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0026.wav|Americans as a whole are feeling a lot better -- a lot more cheerful than for many, many years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0027.wav|The most difficult place in the world to get a clear open perspective of the country as a whole is Washington.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0028.wav|I am reminded sometimes of what President Wilson once said:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0029.wav|So many people come to Washington who know things that are not so,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0031.wav|That is why I occasionally leave this scene of action for a few days
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0033.wav|"To get away from the trees", as they say, "and to look at the whole forest."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0035.wav|is one which, in a very special manner, attaches to this office to which you have chosen me.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0036.wav|Did you ever stop to think that there are, after all, only two positions in the nation
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0037.wav|that are filled by the vote of all of the voters -- the President and the Vice-President?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0039.wav|I speak, therefore, tonight, to and of the American people as a whole.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0040.wav|My most immediate concern is in carrying out the purposes of the great work program just enacted by the Congress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0041.wav|Its first objective is to put men and women now on the relief rolls to work and, incidentally,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0042.wav|to assist materially in our already unmistakable march toward recovery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0043.wav|I shall not confuse my discussion by a multitude of figures. So many figures are quoted to prove so many things.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0045.wav|Therefore, let us keep our minds on two or three simple, essential facts in connection with this problem of unemployment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0047.wav|However, for the first time in five years the relief rolls have declined instead of increased during the winter months.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0050.wav|and every day that passes offers more chances to work for those who want to work.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0051.wav|In spite of the fact that unemployment remains a serious problem
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0053.wav|These measures are of two kinds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0054.wav|The first is to make provisions intended to relieve, to minimize, and to prevent future unemployment;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0055.wav|the second is to establish the practical means to help those who are unemployed in this present emergency.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0057.wav|The program for social security now pending before the Congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0058.wav|While our present and projected expenditures for work relief are wholly within the reasonable limits of our national credit resources,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0059.wav|it is obvious that we cannot continue to create governmental deficits for that purpose year after year.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0062.wav|It proposes, by means of old age pensions,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0063.wav|to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0069.wav|in order that unemployment may be prevented by the stabilizing of employment itself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0070.wav|Provisions for social security, however, are protections for the future.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0072.wav|through the most comprehensive work plan in the history of the nation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0074.wav|It is a problem quite as much for private industry as for the government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0078.wav|one. The projects should be useful.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0081.wav|Funds allotted for each project should be actually and promptly spent and not held over until later years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0082.wav|In all cases projects must be of a character to give employment to those on the relief rolls.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0084.wav|I next want to make it clear exactly how we shall direct the work.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0085.wav|I have set up a Division of Applications and Information
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0086.wav|to which all proposals for the expenditure of money must go for preliminary study and consideration.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0092.wav|and such projects as they approve will be next submitted to the President who under the Act is required to make final allocations.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0093.wav|The next step will be to notify the proper government agency
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0095.wav|This Division will have the duty of coordinating the purchases of materials and supplies
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0099.wav|to move as rapidly as possible back into private employment when such employment is available.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0103.wav|The national government now has at least sixty different agencies with the staff
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0105.wav|These agencies, therefore, will simply be doing on a somewhat enlarged scale the same sort of things that they have been doing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0106.wav|This will make certain that the largest possible portion of the funds allotted
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0108.wav|For many months preparations have been under way.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0110.wav|The key men for the major responsibilities of this great task already have been selected.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0111.wav|I well realize that the country is expecting before this year is out to see the "dirt fly", as they say, in carrying on the work,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0116.wav|generated by this depression
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0117.wav|Our attack upon these enemies must be without stint and without discrimination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0120.wav|there may be occasional instances of inefficiency, bad management, or misuse of funds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0122.wav|there will be those, of course, who will try to tell you that the exceptional failure is characteristic of the entire endeavor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0124.wav|There are chiselers in every walk of life; there are those in every industry who are guilty of unfair practices;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0127.wav|The most effective means of preventing such evils in this Works Relief program will be the eternal vigilance of the American people themselves.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0128.wav|I call upon my fellow citizens everywhere to cooperate with me
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0139.wav|with which we have been concerned for two years.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0140.wav|I can mention only a few of them tonight, but I do not want my mention of specific measures
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0141.wav|to be interpreted as lack of interest in or disapproval of many other important proposals that are pending.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0142.wav|The National Industrial Recovery Act expires on the sixteenth of June.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0143.wav|After careful consideration, I have asked the Congress to extend the life of this useful agency of government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0145.wav|we have found from time to time more and more useful ways of promoting its purposes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0146.wav|No reasonable person wants to abandon our present gains
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0147.wav|we must continue to protect children,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0150.wav|to eliminate so far as humanly possible, the kinds of unfair practices by selfish minorities which unfortunately

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0155.wav|Power production in this country is virtually back to the nineteen twenty-nine peak.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0156.wav|The operating companies in the gas and electric utility field are by and large in good condition, but
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0157.wav|under holding company domination the utility industry has long been hopelessly at war within itself and with public sentiment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0158.wav|By far the greater part of the general decline in utility securities had occurred before I was inaugurated.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0159.wav|The absentee management of unnecessary holding company control
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0161.wav|Even more significantly it has given the country as a whole an uneasy apprehension of overconcentrated economic power.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0162.wav|A business that loses the confidence of its customers and the goodwill of the public cannot long continue to be a good risk for the investor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0163.wav|This legislation will serve the investor by ending the conditions which have caused that lack of confidence and goodwill.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0165.wav|both in its public relations and in its internal relations.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0166.wav|This legislation will not only in the long run result in providing lower electric and gas rates to the consumer,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0175.wav|in which the benefits of private ownership are retained while the public stake in these important services is protected by the public's government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0176.wav|Finally, the reestablishment of public confidence in the banks of the nation
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0177.wav|is one of the most hopeful results of our efforts as a Nation to reestablish public confidence in private banking.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0178.wav|We all know that private banking actually exists by virtue of the permission of and regulation by the people as a whole,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0181.wav|but that its resources be most fully utilized in the economic life of the country
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0184.wav|not by a few private banking institutions, but by a body with public prestige and authority.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0186.wav|Twenty years of experience with this system have justified the efforts made to create it,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0187.wav|but these twenty years have shown by experience definite possibilities for improvement.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0189.wav|They are a minimum of wise readjustments of our Federal Reserve System in the light of past experience and present needs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0190.wav|These measures I have mentioned are, in large part, the program which under my constitutional duty I have recommended to the Congress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0191.wav|They are essential factors in a rounded program for national recovery.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0192.wav|They contemplate the enrichment of our national life

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0196.wav|It is the recovery of confidence in our democratic processes and institutions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0199.wav|Fear is vanishing and confidence is growing on every side,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0202.wav|That faith is receiving its just reward.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0009.wav|Soon after, with the authority of the Congress,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0010.wav|we asked the nation to turn over all of its privately held gold, dollar for dollar, to the government of the United States.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0011.wav|Today's recovery proves how right that policy was.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0015.wav|to exact a pound of flesh was more sacred than the main objectives of the Constitution to establish an enduring Nation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0016.wav|In nineteen thirty-three you and I knew that we must never let our economic system get completely out of joint again
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0017.wav|that we could not afford to take the risk of another great depression.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0018.wav|We also became convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of those dark days was to have a government with power to prevent
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0019.wav|and to cure the abuses and the inequalities which had thrown that system out of joint.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0020.wav|We then began a program of remedying those abuses and inequalities -- to give balance and stability to our economic system

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0029.wav|we cannot delay one moment in making certain that our national government has power to carry through.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0030.wav|Four years ago action did not come until the eleventh hour.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0031.wav|It was almost too late.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0033.wav|we will not allow ourselves to run around in new circles of futile discussion and debate, always postponing the day of decision.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0045.wav|Last Thursday I described the American form of government as a three horse team provided by the Constitution to the American people
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0046.wav|so that their field might be plowed.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0063.wav|But the framers went further.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0065.wav|they gave to the Congress the ample broad powers "to levy taxes

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0107.wav|In the face of such dissenting opinions, it is perfectly clear that, as Chief Justice Hughes has said,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0111.wav|reading into the Constitution words and implications which are not there, and which were never intended to be there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0114.wav|We must find a way to take an appeal from the Supreme Court to the Constitution itself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0115.wav|We want a Supreme Court which will do justice under the Constitution -- not over it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0116.wav|In our courts we want a government of laws and not of men.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0117.wav|I want -- as all Americans want -- an independent judiciary as proposed by the framers of the Constitution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0118.wav|That means a Supreme Court that will enforce the Constitution as written
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0119.wav|that will refuse to amend the Constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power -- amended by judicial say-so.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0120.wav|It does not mean a judiciary so independent that it can deny the existence of facts which are universally recognized.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0121.wav|How then could we proceed to perform the mandate given us?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0123.wav|If these problems cannot be effectively solved within the Constitution,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0124.wav|we shall seek such clarifying amendment as will assure the power to enact those laws,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0126.wav|In other words, we said we would seek an amendment only if every other possible means by legislation were to fail.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0127.wav|When I commenced to review the situation with the problem squarely before me,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0128.wav|I came by a process of elimination to the conclusion that, short of amendments,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0129.wav|the only method which was clearly constitutional, and would at the same time carry out other much needed reforms,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0131.wav|We must have men worthy and equipped to carry out impartial justice.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0132.wav|But, at the same time, we must have judges who will bring to the courts a present-day sense of the Constitution
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0134.wav|and reject the legislative powers which the courts have today assumed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0135.wav|In forty-five out of the forty-eight states of the Union, judges are chosen not for life but for a period of years.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0137.wav|Congress has provided financial security
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0138.wav|by offering life pensions at full pay for federal judges on all courts who are willing to retire at seventy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0140.wav|But all federal judges, once appointed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0141.wav|can, if they choose, hold office for life, no matter how old they may get to be.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0006.wav|a new member shall be appointed by the President then in office,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0008.wav|That plan has two chief purposes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0009.wav|By bringing into the judicial system a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood, I hope, first,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0010.wav|to make the administration of all federal justice speedier and, therefore, less costly;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0012.wav|with modern facts and circumstances under which average men have to live and work.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0014.wav|The number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0016.wav|If, for instance, any one of the six justices of the Supreme Court now over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the plan,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0017.wav|no additional place would be created.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0022.wav|It has been discussed and approved by many persons of high authority
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0023.wav|ever since a similar proposal passed the House of Representatives in eighteen sixty-nine.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0024.wav|Why was the age fixed at seventy?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0026.wav|and the rules of many of our universities and of almost every great private business enterprise,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0027.wav|commonly fix the retirement age at seventy years or less.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0028.wav|The statute would apply to all the courts in the federal system.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0030.wav|The plan has met opposition only so far as the Supreme Court of the United States itself is concerned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0031.wav|If such a plan is good for the lower courts it certainly ought to be equally good for the highest court from which there is no appeal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0032.wav|Those opposing this plan have sought to arouse prejudice and fear by crying that I am seeking to "pack" the Supreme Court
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0033.wav|and that a baneful precedent will be established.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0034.wav|What do they mean by the words "packing the Court"?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0035.wav|Let me answer this question with a bluntness that will end all honest misunderstanding of my purposes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0038.wav|that no President fit for his office would appoint,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0039.wav|and no Senate of honorable men fit for their office would confirm, that kind of appointees to the Supreme Court.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0041.wav|that I would appoint and the Senate would confirm justices worthy to sit beside present members of the Court
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0042.wav|who understand those modern conditions,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0044.wav|that I will appoint justices who will act as justices and not as legislators
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0045.wav|if the appointment of such justices can be called "packing the Courts,"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0047.wav|Is it a dangerous precedent for the Congress to change the number of the justices? The Congress has always had, and will have, that power.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0048.wav|The number of justices has been changed several times before,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0049.wav|in the administration of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson -- both signers of the Declaration of Independence

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0053.wav|Fundamentally, if in the future, America cannot trust the Congress it elects to refrain from abuse of our Constitutional usages
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0058.wav|or make independent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual justice?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0063.wav|President Wilson, three; President Harding, four, including a Chief Justice; President Coolidge, one;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0065.wav|Such a succession of appointments should have provided a Court well-balanced as to age.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0069.wav|Thus a sound public policy has been defeated.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0070.wav|I now propose that we establish by law an assurance against any such ill-balanced court in the future.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0071.wav|I propose that hereafter, when a judge reaches the age of seventy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0072.wav|a new and younger judge shall be added to the court automatically.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0074.wav|instead of leaving the composition of our federal courts, including the highest,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0075.wav|to be determined by chance or the personal indecision of individuals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0076.wav|If such a law as I propose is regarded as establishing a new precedent,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0077.wav|is it not a most desirable precedent?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0079.wav|But the welfare of the United States, and indeed of the Constitution itself, is what we all must think about first.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0080.wav|Our difficulty with the Court today rises not from the Court as an institution but from human beings within it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0081.wav|But we cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men who, being fearful of the future,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0082.wav|would deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0085.wav|and to have it resume its high task of building anew on the Constitution "a system of living law."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0086.wav|The Court itself can best undo what the Court has done.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0089.wav|let us examine the process.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0091.wav|Each one is radically different from the other.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0092.wav|There is no substantial groups within the Congress or outside it who are agreed on any single amendment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0094.wav|It would take months and years thereafter to get a two-thirds majority in favor of that amendment in both Houses of the Congress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0096.wav|No amendment which any powerful economic interests or the leaders of any powerful political party have had reason to oppose
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0098.wav|And thirteen states which contain only five percent of the voting population can block ratification
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0099.wav|even though the thirty- five states with ninety-five percent of the population are in favor of it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0102.wav|would be the first to exclaim as soon as an amendment was proposed
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0104.wav|I am therefore, going to spend my time, my efforts and my money
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0105.wav|to block the amendment, although I would be awfully glad to help get some other kind of amendment ratified.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0106.wav|Two groups oppose my plan on the ground that they favor a constitutional amendment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0108.wav|This is the same group who during the campaign last Fall tried to block the mandate of the people.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0109.wav|Now they are making a last stand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0114.wav|and who would be willing to support a reasonable amendment if they could agree on one.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0115.wav|To them I say: we cannot rely on an amendment as the immediate or only answer to our present difficulties.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0116.wav|When the time comes for action,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0117.wav|you will find that many of those who pretend to support you will sabotage any constructive amendment which is proposed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0118.wav|Look at these strange bed-fellows of yours.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0119.wav|When before have you found them really at your side in your fights for progress?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0120.wav|And remember one thing more.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0122.wav|its meaning would depend upon the kind of justices who would be sitting on the Supreme Court bench.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0124.wav|is what the justices say it is rather than what its framers or you might hope it is.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0126.wav|My record as Governor and President proves my devotion to those liberties.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0127.wav|You who know me can have no fear that I would tolerate the destruction by any branch of government of any part of our heritage of freedom.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0129.wav|brings again to mind that crude and cruel strategy tried by the same opposition
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0132.wav|I am in favor of action through legislation:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0133.wav|First, because I believe that it can be passed at this session of the Congress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0135.wav|liberal-minded judiciary necessary to furnish quicker and cheaper justice from bottom to top.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0136.wav|Third, because it will provide a series of federal courts willing to enforce the Constitution as written,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0139.wav|has been tipped out of balance by the courts in direct contradiction of the high purposes of the framers of the Constitution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0140.wav|It is my purpose to restore that balance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0143.wav|You and I will do our part.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0006.wav|that the functions or workings of the organs of plants, animals or man are quite distinct,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0007.wav|so much so as to require discussion in different treatises.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0013.wav|In the second edition of the "Regne Animal," published in eighteen twenty-eight,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0014.wav|Cuvier devotes a special section to the Division of Organized Beings into Animals and Vegetables,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0018.wav|and inanimated beings, which are devoid of these functions and simply vegetable.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0019.wav|Although the roots of plants direct themselves toward moisture and their leaves toward air and light,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0021.wav|yet none of these movements justify the ascription to plants of perception of will.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0022.wav|From the mobility of animals Cuvier, with his characteristic partiality for teleological reasoning,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0026.wav|Following out his teleological argument, Cuvier remarks that the organization of this cavity
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0027.wav|and its appurtenances must needs vary according to the nature of the aliment and the operations which it has to undergo
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0029.wav|while the atmosphere and the earth supply plants with juices ready prepared and which can be absorbed immediately.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0031.wav|there were no means by which the motion of its fluids could be produced by internal causes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0032.wav|Hence arose the second great distinctive character of animals, or the circulatory system, which is less important than the digestive,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0033.wav|since it was unnecessary, and therefore is absent, in the more simple animals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0034.wav|Animals further needed muscles for locomotion and nerves for sensibility.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0035.wav|Hence, says Cuvier, it was necessary that the chemical composition of the animal body should be more complicated than that of the plant;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0036.wav|and it is so, inasmuch as an additional substance -- nitrogen -- enters into it as an essential element;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0037.wav|while in plants nitrogen is only accidentally joined with the three other fundamental constituents of organic beings
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0042.wav|They retain the hydrogen and the carbon, exhale the superfluous oxygen and absorb little or no nitrogen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0043.wav|The essential character of vegetable life is the exhalation of oxygen, which is effected through the agency of light.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0044.wav|Animals, on the contrary, derive their nourishment either directly or indirectly from plants.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0045.wav|They get rid of the superfluous hydrogen and carbon and accumulate nitrogen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0047.wav|The plant withdraws water and carbonic acid from the atmosphere, the animal contributes both to it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0056.wav|That the semi-fluid contents (which we now term protoplasm) of the cells of certain plants,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0057.wav|such as the Charae, are in constant and regular motion was made out by Bonaventura Corti a century ago;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0059.wav|Robert Brown noted the more complex motions of the protoplasm in the cells of Tradescantia in eighteen thirty-one,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0061.wav|Agardh and other of the botanists of Cuvier's generation who occupied themselves with the lower plants had observed that,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0063.wav|and with all the appearances of spontaneity as locomotive bodies,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0068.wav|"At the present day," writes Huxley,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0070.wav|in nowise distinguishable from that of one of the simpler animals, and
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0071.wav|while in this condition their movements are, to all appearances, as spontaneous -- as much the product of volition -- as those of such animals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0072.wav|Hence the teleological argument for Cuvier's first diagnostic character
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0073.wav|the presence in animals of an alimentary cavity, or internal pocket, in which they can carry about their nutriment
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0074.wav|has broken down, so far, at least, as his mode of stating it goes. And
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0075.wav|with the advance of microscopic anatomy, the universality of the fact itself among animals has ceased to be predicable.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0077.wav|Their food is provided for them,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0080.wav|Finally amid the lowest forms of animal life the speck of gelatinous protoplasm, which constitutes the whole body,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0082.wav|But although Cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0084.wav|And if we substitute for the possession of an alimentary cavity the power of taking solid nutriment into the body and there digesting it,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0085.wav|the definition so changed will cover all animals, except certain parasites,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0089.wav|The third distinction is based on a completely erroneous conception of the chemical differences
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0090.wav|and resemblances between the constituents of animal and vegetable organisms, for which Cuvier is not responsible,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0091.wav|as it was current among contemporary chemists.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0092.wav|It is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0093.wav|and that the latter is, chemically speaking, just as complicated as the former.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0094.wav|Starchy substances, cellulose and sugar,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0095.wav|once supposed to be exclusively confined to plants, are now known to be regular and normal products of animals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0097.wav|Cellulose is widespread as a constituent of the skeletons of the lower animals
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0101.wav|decomposes carbonic acid and exhales oxygen while the animal absorbs oxygen and exhales carbonic acid,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0102.wav|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0103.wav|of attempting to draw any general distinction between animals and vegetables on this ground. In fact, the difference vanishes with the sunshine,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0104.wav|even in the case of the green plant, which in the dark absorbs oxygen and gives out carbonic acid like any animal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0106.wav|which contain no chlorophyll and are not green, are always, so far as respiration is concerned, in the exact position of animals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0107.wav|They absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0109.wav|has been as completely invalidated as the third and second, and even the first can be retained only in a modified form
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0111.wav|But has the advance of biology simply tended to break down old distinctions without establishing new ones?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0112.wav|With a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0115.wav|and from that day to this the rapid improvement of methods of investigation and the energy of a host of accurate observers
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0117.wav|that a fundamental unity of structure obtains in animals and plants,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0118.wav|and that, however diverse may be the fabrics or tissues of which their bodies are composed, all these varied structures result
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0119.wav|from the metamorphosis of morphological units (termed cells in a more general sense than that in which the word "cells" was at first employed),

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0127.wav|while neglecting to maintain his unity of ideal in the case of nearly all the numerous species of snakes, he should have added a tiny rudiment in the case of the Python

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0134.wav|Most remarkable of all the principles which have been discovered by embryologists is the "Recapitulation Doctrine"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0135.wav|which, briefly stated, is that individual development (ontogeny) recapitulates ancestral history (phylogeny).
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0136.wav|Illustrations quoted from the works of Romanes and Le Conte will make this principle clear.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0138.wav|that there is often a close correspondence between developmental changes as revealed by any chronological series of fossils which may happen to have been preserved,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0139.wav|and developmental changes which may be observed during the life history of now existing individuals belonging to the same group of animals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0141.wav|is closely reproduced in the life-history of existing deer. Or, in other words,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0143.wav|whereby the primitive horn was gradually superseded by horns presenting a greater and greater number of prongs in successive species of extinct deer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0145.wav|that such a recapitulation in the life history of an existing animal of developmental changes successively distinctive of sundry allied,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0146.wav|though now extinct species, speaks strongly in favor of evolution.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0151.wav|The only alternative view is that as species of deer,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0153.wav|in order to be so added to successive species, every individual deer belonging to later species was required to repeat in his own lifetime
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0154.wav|the process of successive additions which had previously taken place in a remote series of extinct species.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0155.wav|Now I do not deny that this view is a possible view; but I do deny that it is a probable one.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0156.wav|According to the evolutionary interpretation of such facts, we can see a very good reason why the life-history of the individual
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0157.wav|is thus a condensed resume of the life history of its ancestral species.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0158.wav|But according to the opposite view no reason can be assigned why such should be the case.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0160.wav|that the embryo or larva of a frog or toad, when first hatched, is a legless, tail-swimming, water-breathing, gill-breathing animal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0161.wav|It is essentially a fish, and would be so classed if it remained in this condition.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0162.wav|The fish retains permanently this form, but the frog passes on.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0165.wav|Now, the lower forms of amphibians, such as siredon, menobranchus, siren, etc.,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0166.wav|retain permanently this form, and are therefore called "perennibranchs," but the frog still passes on.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0169.wav|such as the triton, the salamander, etc., which are therefore called "caducibranchs," but the frog still passes on.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0170.wav|Finally, it loses the tail, or rather its tail is absorbed and its material used in further development, and it becomes a perfect frog,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0171.wav|the highest order (anoura) of this class. Thus, then, in ontogeny the fish goes no further than the fish stages.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0173.wav|The caducibranch takes first the fish form, then the perennibranch form, and finally the caducibranch form, but goes no further.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0174.wav|Last, the anoura takes first the fish-form, then that of the perennibranch, then that of the caducibranch, and finally becomes anoura.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0175.wav|Now, this is undoubtedly the order of succession of forms in geological times -- i.e., in the phylogenic series.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0176.wav|Fishes first appeared in the Devonian and Upper Silurian in very reptilian or rather amphibian forms.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0177.wav|Then in the Carboniferous, fishes still continuing, there appeared the lowest -- i.e., most fish-like forms of amphibians.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0178.wav|These were undoubtedly perennibranchs. In the Permian and Triassic higher forms appeared, which were certainly caducibranch.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0120.wav|built the moat-walls of Arachtu with mortar and bricks, and, joining them together with those of my father, made them very solid.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0122.wav|To the west of Babylon, at a greater distance from the outer wall, I constructed an enclosing wall four thousand cubits in length about the city.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0130.wav|And after he had walled the city, and adorned its gates, he built another palace before his father's palace; but so that they joined to it:

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0250.wav|Such, then, were the circumstances of the first taking of Babylon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0251.wav|When Cyrus took Babylon, little or no force was employed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0252.wav|Only the King's son, Belshazzar, was killed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0256.wav|During the reigns of the two following Persian kings Babylon was slowly regaining its independence,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0258.wav|Then the Babylonians secretly plotted to throw off the Persian yoke.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0259.wav|That same year, when Darius Hystaspes came to the Persian throne, the Babylonians openly rebelled.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0261.wav|At last when the time came for rebelling openly they did as follows:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0263.wav|these alone were allowed to live, while all the rest were brought to one place and strangled.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0264.wav|The women chosen were kept to make bread for the men; while the others were strangled that they might not consume the stores.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0265.wav|When tidings reached Darius of what had happened,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0266.wav|he drew together all his power and began the war by marching straight upon Babylon and laying siege to the place.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0267.wav|The Babylonians, however, cared not a whit for his siege.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0268.wav|Mounting upon the battlements that crowned their walls, they insulted and jeered at Darius and his mighty host.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0269.wav|One even shouted to them and said, "Why sit ye there, Persians? Why do ye not go back to your homes? Till mules foal ye will not take our city!"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0273.wav|not even when he tried the means by which Cyrus had made himself master of the place.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0274.wav|The Babylonians were ever upon the watch, and he found no way of conquering them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0275.wav|At last, in the twentieth month,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0277.wav|One of his sumpter-mules gave birth to a foal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0278.wav|Zopyrus, when they told him, not thinking that it could be true, went and saw the colt with his own eyes;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0279.wav|after which he commanded his servants to tell no one what had come to pass, while he himself pondered the matter.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0282.wav|for it seemed to him that there was a divine providence in the man having used the phrase, and then his mule having foaled.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0284.wav|When he found that Darius did indeed value it highly, he considered further with himself how he might make the deed his own, and be the man to take Babylon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0287.wav|but found none by which he could hope to prevail, unless he maimed himself and then went over to the enemy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0288.wav|To do this seeming to him a light matter, he mutilated himself in a way that was utterly without remedy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0289.wav|For he cut off his own nose and ears, and then, clipping his hair close and flogging himself with a scourge,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0291.wav|Wrath stirred within the King at the sight of a man of his lofty rank in such a condition;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0293.wav|Zopyrus answered, "There is not a man in the world, but thou, O King, that could reduce me to such a plight
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0295.wav|I maimed myself because I could not endure that the Assyrians should laugh at the Persians. "Wretched man," said Darius,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0296.wav|thou coverest the foulest deeds with the fairest possible name, when thou sayest thy maiming is to help our siege forward.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0297.wav|How will thy disfigurement, thou simpleton, induce the enemy to yield one day sooner?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0298.wav|Surely thou hadst gone out of thy mind when thou didst so misuse thyself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0299.wav|"Had I told thee," rejoined the other, "what I was bent on doing, thou wouldst not have suffered it;

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0307.wav|then let twenty days pass, and at the end of that time station near the Chaldasan gates a body of four thousand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0312.wav|Having left these instructions, Zopyrus fled towards the gates of the town, often looking back, to give himself the air of a deserter.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0315.wav|He replied that he was Zopyrus, and deserted to them from the Persians.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0317.wav|Introduced into their assembly, he began to bewail his misfortunes, telling them that
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0318.wav|Darius had maltreated him in the way they could see, only because he had given advice that the siege should be raised, since there seemed no hope of taking the city.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0320.wav|will prove the greatest gain that you could possibly receive, while to Darius and the Persians it will be the severest loss.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0321.wav|Verily he by whom I have been so mutilated shall not escape unpunished. And truly all the paths of his counsels are known to me.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0323.wav|The Babylonians, seeing a Persian of such exalted rank in so grievous a plight, his nose and ears cut off,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0327.wav|On the tenth day after his flight he led out his detachment, and surrounding the thousand men,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0328.wav|whom Darius according to agreement had sent first, he fell upon them and slew them all.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0332.wav|Once more, however, he waited till the interval appointed had gone by, and then leading the troops to the place where the four thousand were,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0339.wav|he threw open the Cissian and Belian gates, and admitted the enemy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0342.wav|Thus was Babylon taken for the second time.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0349.wav|who were each required to send so large a number to Babylon, that in all there were collected no fewer than fifty thousand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0350.wav|It is from these women that the Babylonians of our times are sprung.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0351.wav|As for Zopyrus he was considered by Darius to have surpassed, in the greatness of his achievements, all other Persians,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0352.wav|whether of former or of later times, except only Cyrus with whom no person ever yet thought himself worthy to compare.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0355.wav|he gave him likewise the government of Babylon for his life, free from tribute, and he also granted him many other favors.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0356.wav|How much truth there may be in this interesting tale of Herodotus, we may never know,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0358.wav|Cyrus had permitted them to stand, and as long as he made Babylon his home, the city was as strongly protected as ever.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0359.wav|Darius, who besieged the rebellious city twice, weakened it by destroying some of its walls.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0364.wav|The city then fell to Seleucus,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0365.wav|one of Alexander's generals, who for a time made it his home, but he was a Greek and cared little for things Babylonian.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0370.wav|The priests' deception was unavailing, and in two seventy-five B.C., the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to Seleucia.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0372.wav|The poor of the surrounding country occupied its dismantled palaces.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0374.wav|settled there, and finally the place was abandoned to the Arabs of the desert.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0375.wav|Slowly the few remaining walls fell, and were buried in their own ruins.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0377.wav|until at last the foundations of the temples and palaces were buried fully a hundred feet beneath the surface.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0380.wav|The prophecy of the Hebrew Isaiah was fulfilled:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0381.wav|Wild beasts of the desert shall lie there;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0383.wav|and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0384.wav|So Babylon was buried and forgotten.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0385.wav|It had become, as Dio Cassius said, "Mounds and legends and ruins."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0386.wav|But the walls of the old city had not yet served their full purpose.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0387.wav|The Sassanian kings of Persia were fond of hunting, and Babylon, then overgrown with trees, was their game preserve.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0389.wav|St. Jerome said:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0391.wav|that there is a royal hunting ground at Babylon, and that wild game of every kind is contained within the circuit of its walls.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0395.wav|It was a low rampart, enclosing a wide space planted with trees of every sort, in which all kinds of beasts were shut up;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0396.wav|they were supplied with food by keepers, and gave the king the opportunity of hunting whenever he felt inclined.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0399.wav|The spread of Mohammedanism caused new cities to be built, and Babylon was the quarry for their building material.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0403.wav|The walls of the houses are built of them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0404.wav|The courtyards and streets are paved with them, and as you walk about the city the name of Nebuchadnezzar everywhere meets your eye.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0405.wav|Many of the ten thousand people living in Hillah still gain their livelihood by digging the bricks from the ruins to sell to the modern builders.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0408.wav|Some are Arabs of the same tribes which used to roam the desert in Nebuchadnezzar's days. Some are the children of the Hebrew exiles of old.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0410.wav|There among the ruins they still live in the same kind of houses,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0411.wav|dressing the same, eating the same food as did their ancestors when Nebuchadnezzar built the walls of Babylon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0412.wav|Among the first of the modern travelers to describe the ruins of Babylon was Anthony Shirley, an Englishman who visited Mesopotamia in fifteen ninety-nine.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0419.wav|and digging from the wall an inscribed square brick bearing the name of Nebuchadnezzar, he took it to Rome where it may still be seen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0420.wav|That was the first object taken from Babylon to Europe;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0421.wav|it was the beginning of the great collections of Babylonian antiquities in the museums of the Western world.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0423.wav|In eighteen twelve, James Claudius Rich, the British Resident at Baghdad, made the first complete examination of the ruins.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0424.wav|Porter, Layard, and Rawlinson followed him, but the real scientific exploration of Babylon and its walls
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0425.wav|was begun by the Deutsche Orientgesellschaft, in eighteen eighty-nine, and continued till the summer of nineteen fifteen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0426.wav|For fifteen years Dr. Koldewey and his assistants, with a force of two hundred native workmen, have labored there winter and summer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0429.wav|The excavations have shown that Babylon, as the ancients told us, was nearly square.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0432.wav|other parts of them have disappeared entirely.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0433.wav|In the northern part of the enclosure to the east of the river,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0434.wav|the large high mound, which resembles a mountain from a distance, still bears the ancient name Babel.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0435.wav|Arabs, searching for bricks, have burrowed their way down deep into it, revealing massive walls and arches.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0436.wav|The Germans maintain that it is the ruin of the Tower of Babel.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0437.wav|Here, it has been suggested, were the famous hanging gardens which some ancient authors included among the Seven Wonders of the World.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0438.wav|However, it is possible that the hanging gardens existed only in the imagination of the Greek writers,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0439.wav|for none of the many building inscriptions from Nebuchadnezzar mentions them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0444.wav|Deep down in the mound the Germans discovered the palace of Nebuchadnezzar with its hundreds of small chambers and its huge surrounding walls.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0445.wav|The mound still farther south is called Amran, because upon its summit stands the tomb of a Mohammedan saint of that name.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0451.wav|In places even the bases have disappeared, and their moats have long been filled with the drifting sand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0452.wav|The outer wall bore the name of Nimitti-Bel. Its direction was northeast and southwest, forming a triangle with the river.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0454.wav|but both sections originally reached the river.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0455.wav|It seems that the circuit of the outer wall was about eleven miles.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0457.wav|The moat, ten feet deep, and of a width no longer known, ran close to its base. The wall was double.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0458.wav|Its outer part was about twenty-four feet in thickness, and its foundations, as Nebuchadnezzar said, were carried down to the water level.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0464.wav|The intervening space, which was filled with dirt probably to the upper inner edge of the outer part,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0465.wav|served as an elevated road where several chariots might have been driven abreast.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0468.wav|its height was probably more than double its width, but that may never be determined.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0470.wav|Time has dealt even less kindly with it, for it may be traced only for the distance of about a mile along its eastern side.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0476.wav|The entire width of this inner defense was about fifty-five feet; its height is uncertain.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0478.wav|there were drains of large burned bricks, some of which bore the following long inscription:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0479.wav|Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0482.wav|but I, the devout petitioner, the worshipper of the gods, built the moat, and made its wall of burned brick and bitumen mountain high.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0011.wav|President Kennedy's visit to Texas in November nineteen sixty-three had been under consideration for almost a year before it occurred.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0014.wav|As a political leader, the President wished to resolve the factional controversy within the Democratic Party in Texas before the election of nineteen sixty-four.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0016.wav|As Chief of State, the President always welcomed the opportunity to learn, firsthand, about the problems which concerned the American people.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0017.wav|Moreover, he looked forward to the public appearances which he personally enjoyed. The basic decision on the November trip to Texas was made at a meeting of President Kennedy,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0020.wav|and had stopped in El Paso to discuss the proposed visit and other matters with the Vice President and the Governor.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0021.wav|The three agreed that the President would come to Texas in late November nineteen sixty-three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0022.wav|The original plan called for the President to spend only one day in the State, making whirlwind visits to Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Houston.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0023.wav|In September, the White House decided to permit further visits by the President and extended the trip to run from the afternoon of November twenty-one

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0173.wav|he instinctively turned to his right because the shot appeared to come from over his right shoulder.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0177.wav|Mrs. Connally, too, heard a frightening noise from her right.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0180.wav|Roy Kellerman, in the right front seat of the limousine, heard a report like a firecracker pop.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0181.wav|Turning to his right in the direction of the noise, Kellerman heard the President say
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0183.wav|As he told the driver, quote, Let's get out of here; we are hit, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0186.wav|The driver, William Greer, heard a noise which he took to be a backfire from one of the motorcycles flanking the Presidential car.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0187.wav|When he heard the same noise again, Greer glanced over his shoulder and saw Governor Connally fall.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0189.wav|he realized that something was wrong, and he pressed down on the accelerator as Kellerman said, quote, Get out of here fast, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0190.wav|As he issued his instructions to Greer and to the lead car, Kellerman heard a flurry of shots within five seconds of the first noise.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0191.wav|According to Kellerman, Mrs. Kennedy then cried out, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0194.wav|Mrs. Connally heard a second shot fired and pulled her husband down into her lap.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0195.wav|Observing his blood-covered chest as he was pulled into his wife's lap, Governor Connally believed himself mortally wounded.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0196.wav|He cried out, quote, Oh, no, no, no. My God, they are going to kill us all, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0198.wav|but then she noticed an almost imperceptible movement and knew that he was still alive. She said, quote, It's all right. Be still, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0200.wav|At that point, both Governor and Mrs. Connally observed brain tissue splattered over the interior of the car.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0204.wav|Special Agent Hill was scanning the few people standing on the south side of Elm Street after the motorcade had turned off Houston Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0211.wav|Hill jumped from the follow-up car and ran to the President's automobile.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0212.wav|At about the time he reached the President's automobile,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0215.wav|the car lurched forward, causing him to lose his footing. He ran three or four steps, regained his position and mounted the car.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0216.wav|Between the time he originally seized the handhold and the time he mounted the car, Hill recalled:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0217.wav|quote, Mrs. Kennedy had jumped up from the seat and was, it appeared to me, reaching for something coming off the fight rear bumper of the car,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0219.wav|She turned toward me and I grabbed her and put her back in the back seat, crawled up on top of the back seat and lay there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0221.wav|stated that Mrs. Kennedy would probably have fallen off the rear end of the car and been killed if Hill had not pushed her back into the Presidential automobile.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0222.wav|Mrs. Kennedy had no recollection of climbing onto the back of the car.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0223.wav|Special Agent Ready, on the right front running board of the Presidential follow-up car,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0224.wav|heard noises that sounded like firecrackers and ran toward the President's limousine.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0229.wav|At this point the cars were speeding through the underpass and had left the scene of the shooting,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0231.wav|Most of the other Secret Service agents in the motorcade had drawn their sidearms.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0232.wav|Roberts noticed that the Vice President's car was approximately one-half block
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0234.wav|Directing the security detail for the Vice President from the right front seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Special Agent Youngblood recalled, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0235.wav|As we were beginning to go down this incline, all of a sudden there was an explosive noise.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0236.wav|I quickly observed unnatural movement of crowds, like ducking or scattering, and quick movements in the Presidential follow-up car.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0237.wav|So I turned around and hit the Vice President on the shoulder and hollered, get down,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0238.wav|and then looked around again and saw more of this movement, and so I proceeded to go to the back seat and get on top of him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0239.wav|Youngblood was not positive that he was in the rear seat before the second shot, but thought it probable because of President Johnson's statement
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0242.wav|I was startled by the sharp report or explosion,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0243.wav|but I had no time to speculate as to its origin because Agent Youngblood turned in a flash, immediately after the first explosion,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0244.wav|hitting me on the shoulder, and shouted to all of us in the back seat to get down.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0245.wav|I was pushed down by Agent Youngblood.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0246.wav|Almost in the same moment in which he hit or pushed me, he vaulted over the back seat and sat on me.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ030-0249.wav|reported that Youngblood was in the rear seat using his body to shield the Vice President before the second and third shots were fired.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0029.wav|Special Agent Hill removed his suit jacket and covered the President's head and upper chest to prevent the taking of photographs.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0035.wav|For a moment, Mrs. Kennedy refused to release the President, whom she held in her lap,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0036.wav|but then Kellerman, Greer, and Lawson lifted the President onto a stretcher and pushed it into trauma room one.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0040.wav|Approximately two minutes later, Dr. Carrico saw the President on his back, being wheeled into the emergency area.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0041.wav|He noted that the President was blue-white or ashen in color; had slow, spasmodic, agonal respiration without any coordination;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0043.wav|evidenced no palpable pulse; and had a few chest sounds which were thought to be heartbeats.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0044.wav|On the basis of these findings, Dr. Carrico concluded that President Kennedy was still alive.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0045.wav|Dr. Carrico noted two wounds: a small bullet wound in the front lower neck,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0046.wav|and an extensive wound in the President's head where a sizable portion of the skull was missing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0049.wav|Dr. Carrico felt the President's back and determined that there was no large wound there which would be an immediate threat to life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0050.wav|Observing the serious problems presented by the head wound and inadequate respiration, Dr. Carrico directed his attention to improving the President's breathing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0051.wav|He noted contusions, hematoma to the right of the larynx, which was deviated slightly to the left,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0053.wav|Dr. Carrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal tube past the injury, inflated the cuff, and connected it to a Bennett machine to assist in respiration.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0054.wav|At that point, direction of the President's treatment was undertaken by Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who arrived at trauma room one a few moments after the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0056.wav|Observing that an effective airway had to be established if treatment was to be effective, Dr. Perry performed a tracheotomy, which required three to five minutes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0059.wav|Dr. Carrico treated the President's known ad-renal insufficiency by administering hydrocortisone.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0060.wav|Dr. Robert N. McClelland entered at that point and assisted Dr. Perry with the tracheotomy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0061.wav|Dr. Fouad Bashour, chief of cardiology, Dr. M. T. Jenkins, chief of anesthesiology, and Dr. A. H. Giesecke, Jr.,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0063.wav|When Dr. Perry noted free air and blood in the President's chest cavity, he asked that chest tubes be inserted to allow for drainage of blood and air.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0066.wav|the doctors were able to maintain peripheral circulation as monitored at the neck (carotid) artery and at the wrist (radial) pulse.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0068.wav|While these medical efforts were in progress,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0069.wav|Dr. Clark noted some electrical activity on the cardiotachyscope attached to monitor the President's heart responses.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0071.wav|described a large, gaping wound in the right rear part of the head, with substantial damage and exposure of brain tissue, and a considerable loss of blood.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0075.wav|In the absence of any neurological, muscular, or heart response, the doctors concluded that efforts to revive the President were hopeless.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0076.wav|This was verified by Admiral Burkley, the President's physician, who arrived at the hospital after emergency treatment was underway and concluded that, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0077.wav|my direct services to him at that moment would have interfered with the action of the team which was in progress, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0079.wav|He made the official determination because the ultimate cause of death, the severe head injury, was within his sphere of specialization.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0083.wav|the doctors observed that he had a heartbeat and was making some respiratory efforts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0086.wav|the President remained on his back throughout his medical treatment at Parkland.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0087.wav|When asked why he did not turn the President over, Dr. Carrico testified as follows:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0088.wav|This man was in obvious extreme distress and any more thorough inspection would have involved several minutes -- well, several
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0090.wav|A thorough inspection would have involved washing and cleansing the back, and this is not practical in treating an acutely injured patient.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0091.wav|You have to determine which things, which are immediately life threatening and cope with them, before attempting to evaluate the full extent of the injuries.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0093.wav|Answer: No, sir. Before -- well, in trying to treat an acutely injured patient, you have to establish an airway, adequate ventilation
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0094.wav|and you have to establish adequate circulation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0096.wav|Question: Was any effort made to inspect the President's back after he had expired? Answer: No, sir.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0099.wav|Moreover, the Parkland doctors took no further action after the President had expired because they concluded that it was beyond the scope of their permissible duties.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0100.wav|Treatment of Governor Connally
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0101.wav|While one medical team tried to revive President Kennedy, a second performed a series of operations on the bullet wounds sustained by Governor Connally.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0103.wav|While Dr. Carrico went on to attend the President, Dr. Dulany stayed with the Governor and was soon joined by several other doctors.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0105.wav|chief of thoracic surgery, arrived at trauma room two, to take charge of the care of Governor Connally,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0109.wav|At one:thirty-five p.m., after Governor Connally had been moved to the operating room, Dr. Shaw started the first operation
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0110.wav|by cutting away the edges of the wound on the front of the Governor's chest and suturing the damaged lung and lacerated muscles.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0113.wav|This operation was concluded at three:twenty p.m.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0114.wav|Two additional operations were performed on Governor Connally for wounds which he had not realized he had sustained until he regained consciousness the following day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0116.wav|Dr. Charles F. Gregory, chief of orthopedic surgery, operated on the wounds of Governor Connally's right wrist,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0118.wav|The wound on the back of the wrist was left partially open for draining, and the wound on the palm side was enlarged, cleansed, and closed.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0107.wav|When seeking employment in New Orleans,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0108.wav|Oswald listed a "Sgt. Robert Hidell" as a reference on one job application and "George Hidell" as a reference on another.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0109.wav|Both names were found to be fictitious.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0113.wav|Based on the above evidence, the Commission concluded that Oswald purchased the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0116.wav|it was examined by Lt. J. C. Day of the identification bureau of the Dallas police.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0117.wav|He lifted the rifle by the wooden stock after his examination convinced him that the wood was too rough to take fingerprints.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0123.wav|the rifle was released to the FBI and forwarded to Washington where it was examined on the morning of November twenty-three
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0125.wav|In his testimony before the Commission, Latona stated that when he received the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected by cellophane.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0129.wav|Accordingly, my opinion simply was that the latent prints which were there were of no value, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0131.wav|He stated that the poor quality of the wood and the metal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin, thereby making a clear print unlikely.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0157.wav|was a tuft of several cotton fibers of dark blue, gray-black, and orange-yellow shades.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0158.wav|On November twenty-three, nineteen sixty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0159.wav|these fibers were examined by Paul M. Stombaugh, a special agent assigned to the Hair and Fiber Unit of the FBI Laboratory.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0160.wav|He compared them with the fibers found in the shirt which Oswald was wearing when arrested in the Texas Theatre.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0165.wav|to the exclusion of all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics present in fibers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0166.wav|Judgments as to probability will depend on the number and types of matches.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0167.wav|He concluded, quote, There is no doubt in my mind that these fibers could have come from this shirt.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0169.wav|Having considered the probabilities as explained in Stombaugh's testimony,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0174.wav|but Mary Bledsoe, a former landlady of Oswald, saw him on a bus approximately ten minutes after the assassination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0175.wav|and identified the shirt as being the one worn by Oswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt's right elbow.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0176.wav|Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left the bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0177.wav|Although Oswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when questioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0179.wav|In light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional testimony of Stombaugh
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0181.wav|Although Stombaugh was unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle he said that the fibers, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0184.wav|For ten days prior to the eve of the assassination Oswald had not been present at Ruth Paine's house in Irving, Texas, where the rifle was kept.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0187.wav|The fact that on the morning of the assassination Oswald was wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibers most probably originated,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0190.wav|On the other hand Stombaugh pointed out that fibers might retain their freshness if the rifle had been
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0193.wav|Because the relative freshness of these fibers might be explained by the continuous storage of the rifle in the blanket,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0196.wav|This adds to the conviction of the Commission that Oswald owned and handled the weapon used in the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0202.wav|Two pictures were taken. The Commission has concluded that the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0204.wav|Special Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, a photography expert with the FBI,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0205.wav|photographed the rifle used in the assassination, attempting to duplicate the position of the rifle and the lighting in Exhibit Number one thirty-three A.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0208.wav|He found, quote, one notch in the stock at this point that appears very faintly in the photograph, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0210.wav|to the exclusion of all other rifles of the same general configuration, end quote.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0214.wav|Using a recognized technique of determining whether a picture was taken with a particular camera,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0215.wav|Shaneyfelt compared this negative with a negative which he made by taking a new picture with Oswald's camera.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0217.wav|He could not test Exhibit Number one thirty-three A in the same way because the negative was never recovered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0218.wav|Both pictures, however, have identical backgrounds and lighting and, judging from the shadows, were taken at the same angle.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0220.wav|Since Exhibit Number one thirty-three B was taken with Oswald's camera,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0226.wav|The Commission sought to determine whether these photographs were touched prior to publication.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0227.wav|Shaneyfelt testified that the published photographs appeared to be based on a copy of the original which the publications had each retouched differently.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0228.wav|Several of the publications furnished the Commission with the prints they had used, or described by correspondence the retouching they had done.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0231.wav|and other details in the picture.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0234.wav|The rifle was shipped from Klein's in Chicago on March twenty, nineteen sixty-three, at a time when the Oswalds were living on Neely Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0237.wav|it was established that the photographs must have been taken sometime after March twenty-seven.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0238.wav|Marina Oswald testified that the photographs were taken on a Sunday about two weeks before the attempted shooting of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0239.wav|on April ten, nineteen sixty-three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0244.wav|Marina Oswald testified that the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building was the "fateful rifle of Lee Oswald."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0245.wav|Moreover, it was the only rifle owned by her husband following his return from the Soviet Union in June nineteen sixty-two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0247.wav|during the summer of nineteen sixty-three.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0256.wav|Marina Oswald was looking in the garage for parts to the baby's crib and thought that the parts might be in the blanket.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0258.wav|Ruth and Michael Paine both noticed the rolled-up blanket in the garage during the time that Marina Oswald was living in their home.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0259.wav|On several occasions, Michael Paine moved the blanket in the garage.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0263.wav|About three hours after the assassination, a detective and deputy sheriff saw the blanket-roll,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0264.wav|tied with a string, lying on the floor of the Paines' garage.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0269.wav|It could have been caused by the telescopic sight of the rifle which was approximately eleven inches long.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0271.wav|(two) Oswald's palmprint was on the rifle in a position which shows that he had handled it while it was disassembled,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0030.wav|Mrs. A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at ten twenty-six North Beckley Avenue

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0036.wav|No curtain rods were known to have been discovered in the Depository Building after the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0038.wav|the Commission gave weight to the fact that Oswald gave a false reason for returning home on November twenty-one,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0039.wav|and one which provided an excuse for the carrying of a bulky package the following morning.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0040.wav|Before dinner on November twenty-one, Oswald played on the lawn of the Paines' home with his daughter June.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0058.wav|On the day of the assassination, Marina Oswald was watching television when she learned of the shooting.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0198.wav|Despite these matches, however, Stombaugh was unable to render on opinion that the fibers which he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0010.wav|Below the southeast corner window on the sixth floor was a large carton of books
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0013.wav|In front of this small carton and resting partially on the windowsill was another small "Rolling Readers" carton.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0025.wav|as being the left palmprint and right index fingerprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0026.wav|The Commission has considered the possibility that the cartons might have been moved in connection with the work that was being performed on the sixth floor on November twenty-two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0027.wav|Depository employees were laying a new floor at the west end and transferring books from the west to the east end of the building.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0044.wav|The freshness of this print could be estimated only because the Dallas police developed it through the use of powder.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0048.wav|The freshness of prints developed in this manner cannot be estimated,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0085.wav|She was not sure whether she had seen his picture in a newspaper on the afternoon or evening of November twenty-two prior to the lineup.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0098.wav|that he saw Oswald on television the night of the murder and thought that Oswald was the man he had seen running away from the shooting.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0099.wav|On television Oswald's hair looked blond, whereas Smith remembered that the man who ran away had hair that was brown or brownish black.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0106.wav|Both ran to the sidewalk on the east side of Patton at a point about a half a block south of tenth.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0109.wav|He slowed down, halted, said something, and then kept on going to the corner, turned right, and continued west on Jefferson.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0110.wav|Guinyard claimed that the man ran down the east side of Patton and passed within ten feet of him before crossing to the other side.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0116.wav|Guinyard and Callaway viewed the same lineup of four men from which Mrs. Markham had earlier made her identification of Lee Harvey Oswald.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0117.wav|Both men picked Oswald as the man who had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0119.wav|I stepped to the back of the room, so I could kind of see him from the same distance which I had seen him before. And when he came out I knew him, end quote.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0121.wav|Both Callaway and Guinyard testified that they had not been shown any pictures by the police before the lineup.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0122.wav|The Dallas Police Department furnished the Commission with pictures of the men who appeared in the lineups with Oswald,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0123.wav|and the Commission has inquired into general lineup procedures used by the Dallas police as well as the specific procedures in the lineups involving Oswald.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0151.wav|Cunningham declared that this weapon fired the four cartridges to the exclusion of all other weapons.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0154.wav|independently examined the four cartridge cases and arrived at the same conclusion as Cunningham.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0155.wav|At the request of the Commission, Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal Identification Investigation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0160.wav|He explained that the bullets were slightly smaller than the barrel of the pistol which had fired them. This caused the bullets to have an erratic passage through the barrel
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0161.wav|and impressed upon the lead of the bullets inconsistent individual characteristics which made identification impossible.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0162.wav|Consecutive bullets fired from the revolver by the FBI experts could not be identified as having been fired from that revolver.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0164.wav|All four bullets were fired from a weapon
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0166.wav|He concluded, however, that he could not say whether the four bullets were fired from the revolver in Oswald's possession.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0168.wav|Nicol differed with the FBI experts on one bullet taken from Tippit's body.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0169.wav|He declared that this bullet was fired from the same weapon that fired the test bullets to the exclusion of all other weapons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0175.wav|Therefore, one cartridge case of this type was not recovered.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0099.wav|In accordance with standard Marine procedures, Oswald received extensive training in marksmanship.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0100.wav|During the first week of an intensive eight-week training period he received instruction in sighting, aiming, and manipulation of the trigger.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0101.wav|He went through a series of exercises called dry firing where he assumed all positions which would later be used in the qualification course.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0102.wav|After familiarization with live ammunition in the twenty-two rifle and the twenty-two pistol,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0105.wav|Following that training, Oswald was tested in December of nineteen fifty-six, and obtained a score of two hundred twelve,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0106.wav|which was two points above the minimum for qualifications as a "sharpshooter" in a scale of marksman, sharpshooter, expert.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0114.wav|When asked to explain the different scores achieved by Oswald on the two occasions when he fired for record,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0117.wav|He had the services of an experienced highly trained coach.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0123.wav|because he may well have carried this rifle for quite some time, and it got banged around in normal usage.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0125.wav|that Oswald was a good shot, somewhat better than or equal to -- better than the average let us say.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0126.wav|As compared to a civilian who had not received this intensive training, he would be considered as a good to excellent shot. End quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0128.wav|Based on that training, his basic knowledge in sight manipulation and trigger squeeze and what not, I would say that he would be capable of sighting that rifle in well,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0129.wav|firing it, with ten rounds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0131.wav|Sergeant Zahm concluded, quote, I would say in the Marine Corps he is a good shot, slightly above average,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0140.wav|Soon after Oswald returned from the Soviet Union
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0146.wav|Marina Oswald testified that in New Orleans in May of nineteen sixty-three, she observed Oswald sitting with the rifle on their screened porch at night,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0161.wav|and the Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch of the U.S. Army. There were no misfires.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0163.wav|the Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory had expert riflemen fire the assassination weapon

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0174.wav|The marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target and all hit the target.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0175.wav|For the first four attempts, the firers missed the second shot by several inches.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0176.wav|The angle from the first to the second shot
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0178.wav|This angle was used in the test because the majority of the eyewitnesses to the assassination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0179.wav|stated that there was a shorter interval between shots two and three than between shots one and two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0181.wav|the shots would have been evenly spaced and the assassin would not have incurred so sharp an angular movement.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0182.wav|Five of the six shots hit the third target where the angle of movement of the weapon was small.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0183.wav|On the basis of these results, Simmons testified that in his opinion the probability of hitting the targets at the relatively short range at which they were hit
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0184.wav|Considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during the actual assassination,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0187.wav|In fact, one of the firers in the rapid fire test in firing his two series of three shots,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0188.wav|hit the target twice within a span of four point six and five point one five seconds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0189.wav|The others would have been able to reduce their times if they had been given the opportunity to become familiar with the movement of the bolt and the trigger pull.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0190.wav|Simmons testified that familiarity with the bolt could be achieved in dry practice and, as has been indicated above,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0192.wav|he had a total of between four point eight and five point six seconds between the two shots which hit
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0193.wav|and a total minimum time period of from seven point one to seven point nine seconds for all three shots.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0194.wav|All three of the firers in these tests
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0197.wav|The purpose of this experiment was not to test the rifle under conditions which prevailed at the time of the assassination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0199.wav|The three FBI experts each fired three shots from the weapon at fifteen yards in six, seven, and nine seconds,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0200.wav|and one of these agents, Robert A. Frazier,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0201.wav|fired two series of three shots at twenty-five yards in four point six and four point eight seconds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0202.wav|At fifteen yards each man's shots landed within the size of a dime.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0203.wav|The shots fired by Frazier at the range of twenty-five yards landed within an area of two inches and five inches respectively.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0204.wav|Frazier later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of one hundred yards in five point nine, six point two,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0205.wav|five point six, and six point five seconds.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0208.wav|this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0210.wav|Frazier testified that while he could not tell when the defect occurred, but that a person familiar with the weapon could compensate for it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0211.wav|Moreover, the defect was one which would have assisted the assassin aiming at a target which was moving away.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0212.wav|Frazier said, quote, The fact that the crosshairs are set high would actually compensate for any lead which had to be taken
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0213.wav|So that if you aimed with this weapon as it actually was received at the laboratory, it would not be necessary to take any lead whatsoever
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0214.wav|in order to hit the intended object. The scope would accomplish the lead for you, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0217.wav|Based on these tests the experts agreed that the assassination rifle was an accurate weapon.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0219.wav|Frazier testified that the rifle was accurate, that it had less recoil than the average military rifle
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0222.wav|was a substantial aid to rapid, accurate firing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0225.wav|Based on the known facts of the assassination,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0231.wav|Having fired this slot

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ039-0238.wav|that it was an easy shot to hit some part of the President's body, and that the range where the rifleman would be expected to hit

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0005.wav|There remains the question of what impelled Oswald to conceive and to carry out the assassination of the President of the United States.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0008.wav|a desire to effect changes in the structure of society or simply to go down in history as a well publicized assassin.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0015.wav|There is, however, a large amount of material available in his writings
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0017.wav|Since Oswald is dead,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0022.wav|Indications of Oswald's motivation
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0023.wav|may be obtained from a study of the events, relationships and influences which appear to have been significant in shaping his character and in guiding him.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0030.wav|When he was in the Soviet Union, he apparently resented the Communist Party members,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0032.wav|He accused his wife of preferring others to himself and told her to return to the Soviet Union without him but without a divorce.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0033.wav|At the same time he professed his love for her and said that he could not get along without her.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0038.wav|Such ideas of grandeur were apparently accompanied by notions of oppression.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0040.wav|which he expressed in striking and sometimes violent acts long before the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0044.wav|Oswald apparently started reading about communism when he was about fifteen.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0045.wav|In the Marines, he evidenced a strong conviction as to the correctness of Marxist doctrine,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0048.wav|Oswald did not always distinguish between Marxism and communism.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0050.wav|His attachment to Marxist and Communist doctrine was probably, in some measure, an expression of his hostility to his environment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0051.wav|While there is doubt about how fully Oswald understood the doctrine which he so often espoused, it seems clear
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0054.wav|It was a factor which contributed to his character and thereby might have influenced his decision to assassinate President Kennedy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0057.wav|It will examine his defection to the Soviet Union in nineteen fifty-nine, his subsequent return to the United States and his life here

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0062.wav|The Early Years
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0063.wav|Significant in shaping the character of Lee Harvey Oswald was the death of his father, a collector of insurance premiums.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0064.wav|This occurred two months before Lee was born in New Orleans on October eighteen, nineteen thirty-nine.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0066.wav|It had its effect on Lee's mother, Marguerite, his brother Robert, who had been born in nineteen thirty-four,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0067.wav|and his half-brother John Pic, who had been born in nineteen thirty-two during Marguerite's previous marriage.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0068.wav|It forced Marguerite Oswald to go to work to provide for her family.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0072.wav|he was cared for principally by his mother's sister, by babysitters and by his mother, when she had time for him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0073.wav|Marguerite Oswald withdrew Lee from the orphans' home and took him with her to Dallas when he was a little over four years old.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0075.wav|Apparently that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage to Edwin A. Ekdahl, which took place in May of nineteen forty-five.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0078.wav|Lee Oswald remained with his mother and Ekdahl, to whom he became quite attached.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0080.wav|That situation, however, was short-lived,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0083.wav|After the divorce Mrs. Oswald complained considerably about how unfairly she was treated,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0084.wav|dwelling on the fact that she was a widow with three children.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0086.wav|In the fall of nineteen forty-eight she told John Pic and Robert Oswald
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0087.wav|that she could not afford to send them back to the military school and she asked Pic to quit school entirely to help support the family.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0088.wav|which he did for four months in the fall of nineteen forty-eight.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0090.wav|Pic did turn over part of his income to his mother,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0095.wav|Referring to the period after the divorce from Ekdahl, which was apparently caused in part by Marguerite's desire to get more money from him,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0098.wav|Marguerite Oswald worked in miscellaneous jobs after her divorce from Ekdahl.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0099.wav|When she worked for a time as an insurance saleslady,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0100.wav|she would sometimes take Lee with her, apparently leaving him alone in the car while she transacted her business.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0101.wav|When she worked during the school year, Lee had to leave an empty house in the morning,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0102.wav|return to it for lunch and then again at night, his mother having trained him to do that rather than to play with other children.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0104.wav|when he was sent to New Orleans to visit the family of his mother's sister, Mrs. Lillian Murret, for two or three weeks.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0105.wav|Despite their urgings, he refused to play with the other children his own age.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0106.wav|It also appears that Lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0109.wav|Whatever problems may have been created by Lee's home life in Louisiana and Texas,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0148.wav|Oswald's withdrawn tendencies and solitary habits were thought to be the result of, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0149.wav|intense anxiety, shyness, feelings of awkwardness and insecurity, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0151.wav|He was also described as having a, quote, Vivid fantasy life,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0166.wav|She also noted that there was, quote, a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved, affectionless youngster

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0168.wav|She thought that he had detached himself from the world around him because, quote, no one in it ever met any of his needs for love, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0169.wav|She observed that since Lee's mother worked all day, he made his own meals and spent all his time alone
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0170.wav|because he didn't make friends with the boys in the neighborhood. She thought that he, quote, withdrew into a completely solitary and detached existence
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0171.wav|where he did as he wanted and he didn't have to live by any rules or come into contact with people, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0178.wav|A psychological human figure-drawing test corroborated the interviewer's findings that Lee was insecure and had limited social contacts.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0183.wav|There is some indication that he may relate to men more easily than to women in view of the more mature conceptualisation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0184.wav|He appears slightly withdrawn and in view of the lack of detail within the drawings this may assume a more significant characteristic.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0188.wav|Sokolow said that although Lee was, quote, presumably disinterested in school subjects he operates on a much higher than average level, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0189.wav|On the Monroe Silent Reading Test, Lee's score indicated no retardation in reading speed and comprehension;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0191.wav|Lee told Carro, his probation officer, that he liked to be by himself because he had too much difficulty in making friends.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0195.wav|It appears that he did not want to do any of the things which the authorities suggested in their efforts to bring him out of the shell
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0196.wav|into which he appeared to be retreating.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0198.wav|On the other hand he also told her that he wished his mother had been more firm with him in her attempts to get him to return to school.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0199.wav|The reports of the New York authorities indicate that Lee's mother gave him very little affection and did not serve as any sort of substitute for a father.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0202.wav|Mrs. Siegel described her as a smartly dressed, gray haired woman, very self-possessed and alert and superficially affable,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0206.wav|that Lee's withdrawal was a form of, quote, violent but silent protest against his neglect by her
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0210.wav|It may also be significant that, as reported by John Pic, quote, Lee slept with my mother until I joined the service in nineteen fifty.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0211.wav|This would make him approximately ten, well, almost eleven years old. End quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0212.wav|The factors in Lee Oswald's personality which were noted by those who had contact with him in New York indicate
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0215.wav|Those factors indicated a severe inability to enter into relationships with other people.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0216.wav|In view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in New Orleans in the spring of nineteen fifty, and his other solitary habits,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0217.wav|Lee had apparently been experiencing similar problems before going to New York,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0218.wav|and as will be shown below, this failure to adapt to his environment was a dominant trait in his later life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0219.wav|It would be incorrect, however, to believe that those aspects of Lee's personality which were observed in New York
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0223.wav|his lack of friends, the apparent unavailability of any agency assistance and the ineffectualness of his mother
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0224.wav|and not on any particular mental disturbance, in the boy himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0225.wav|Carro testified that, quote, There was nothing that would lead me to believe when I saw him at the age of twelve that them would be seeds of destruction for somebody.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0226.wav|I couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0227.wav|Mrs. Siegel concluded her report with the statement that, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0228.wav|Despite his withdrawal, he gives the impression that he is not so difficult to reach as he appears and patient, prolonged effort
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0229.wav|in a sustained relationship with one therapist might bring results.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0231.wav|Lee Oswald never received that help.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0233.wav|and when one of the city's clinics did find room to handle him,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0004.wav|After his return to New Orleans Oswald was teased at school because of the northern accent which he had acquired.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0006.wav|His mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in school.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0007.wav|Neighbors and others who knew him at that time recall an introverted boy who read a great deal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0008.wav|He took walks and visited museums, and sometimes rode a rented bicycle in the park on Saturday mornings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0012.wav|Once a group of white boys beat him up for sitting in the Negro section of a bus, which he apparently did simply out of ignorance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0013.wav|Another time, he fought with two brothers who claimed that he had picked on the younger of them, three years Oswald's junior.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0017.wav|Voebel also recalled that Oswald once outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window of a store on Rampart Street and steal a pistol,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0021.wav|In a space for the names of, quote, close friends, end quote, on the ninth grade personal history record,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0023.wav|and, quote, Arthor Abear, end quote, most likely Arthur Hebert, a classmate who has said that he did not know Oswald well.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0024.wav|Oswald erased those names, however, and indicated that he had no close friends.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0025.wav|It has been suggested that this misspelling of names, apparently on a phonetic basis, was caused by a reading-spelling disability
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0026.wav|from which Oswald appeared to suffer.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0027.wav|Other evidence of the existence of such a disability is provided by the many other misspellings that appear in Oswald's writings, portions of which are quoted below.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0028.wav|Sometime during this period, and under circumstances to be discussed more fully below,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0029.wav|Oswald started to read Communist literature, which he obtained from the public library.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0033.wav|The association's then president, William E. Wulf, testified that he remembered an occasion when Oswald, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0034.wav|started expounding the Communist doctrine and saying that he was highly interested in communism, that communism was the only way of life for the worker, et cetera,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0035.wav|and then came out with a statement that he was looking for a Communist cell in town to join but he couldn't find any.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0036.wav|He was a little dismayed at this, and he said that he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a Communist,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0037.wav|and subsequently, after this conversation, my father came in and we were kind of arguing back and forth about the situation, and my father came in the room,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0042.wav|He wrote a note in his mother's name to school authorities in New Orleans saying that he was leaving school because he and his mother were moving to San Diego.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0044.wav|While he apparently was able to induce his mother to make a false statement about his age
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0045.wav|he was nevertheless unable to convince the proper authorities that he was really seventeen years old.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0049.wav|According to Marguerite Oswald, quote, Lee lived for the time that he would become seventeen years old to join the Marines -- that whole year, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0050.wav|In John Pic's view,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0051.wav|Oswald was motivated to join the Marines in large part by a desire, quote, to get from out and under the yoke of oppression from my mother, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0057.wav|His study of Communist literature,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0059.wav|His difficulty in relating to other people and his general dissatisfaction with the world around him continued while he was in the Marine Corps.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0061.wav|who, shortly after Oswald's defection, wrote an as yet unpublished novel based in considerable part on Oswald's life,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0063.wav|He said that Oswald, quote, seemed to guard against developing real close friendships, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0064.wav|Daniel Powers, another marine who was stationed with Oswald for part of his marine career,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0066.wav|his general personality would alienate the group against him, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0067.wav|Other marines also testified that Oswald had few friends and kept very much to himself.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0071.wav|His Marine career was not helped by his attitude
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0074.wav|John E. Donovan, one of his former officers, testified that Oswald thought, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0076.wav|and put them in positions of prominence, end quote. Oswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0077.wav|He led them into discussions of foreign affairs about which they often knew less than he did, since he had apparently devoted considerable time to a study of such matters.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0079.wav|Nelson Delgado, one of Oswald's fellow Marines, testified that Oswald tried to, quote, cut up anybody that was high ranking, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0081.wav|Oswald probably engaged his superiors in arguments on a subject that he had studied
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0082.wav|in an attempt to attract attention to himself and to support his exaggerated idea of his own abilities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0085.wav|Oswald, quote, seemed to be a person who would go out of his way to get into trouble, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0088.wav|which he strove to maintain and, quote, felt the Marine Corps kept a pretty close watch on him because of his subversive activities, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0089.wav|Thornley added, quote, I think it was kind of necessary to him to believe that he was being picked on.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0090.wav|It wasn't anything extreme. I wouldn't go as far as to call it, call him a paranoid, but a definite tendency there was in that direction, I think, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0091.wav|Powers considered Oswald to be meek and easily led
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0093.wav|Powers also testified that Oswald was reserved and seemed to be, quote, somewhat the frail, little puppy in the litter, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0095.wav|Oswald read a good deal, said Powers, but, quote, he would never be reading any of the shoot-em-up westerns or anything like that.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0098.wav|All the Marine Corps did was to teach you to kill and after you got out of the Marines you might be good gangsters, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0101.wav|aggressive and even somewhat pugnacious, although Powers, quote, wouldn't say that this guy is a troublemaker, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0102.wav|Powers said, quote, now he was Oswald the man rather than Oswald the rabbit, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0106.wav|At the court-martial hearing which followed, Oswald admitted that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0110.wav|canceling the suspension of a twenty-day sentence that Oswald had received in an earlier court-martial
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0114.wav|three months prior to his regularly scheduled separation date, ostensibly to care for his mother who had been injured in an accident at her work.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0116.wav|after it was learned that he had defected to the Soviet Union.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0117.wav|In an attempt to have this discharge reversed,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0122.wav|and he must have known that President Kennedy had had nothing to do with it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0124.wav|Marina Oswald testified that she, quote, had never heard anything bad about Kennedy from Lee. And he never had anything against him, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0125.wav|Mrs. Oswald said that her husband did not say anything about Governor Connally after his return to the United States. She testified, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0127.wav|Oswald must have already learned that the Governor could not help him with his discharge because he was no longer Secretary of the Navy, at the time he made that remark.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0131.wav|and also because he had not received any notice of the original discharge proceedings, since his whereabouts were not known.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0134.wav|Governor Connally's connection with the discharge, although indirect, caused the Commission to consider whether he might have been Oswald's real target.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0136.wav|was shooting at Connally rather than President Kennedy, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0137.wav|In support of her conclusion Mrs. Oswald noted her husband's undesirable discharge
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0138.wav|and that she could not think of any reason why Oswald would want to kill President Kennedy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0139.wav|It should be noted, however, that at the time Oswald fired the shots at the Presidential limousine the Governor occupied the seat in front of the President,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0140.wav|and it would have been almost impossible for Oswald to have hit the Governor without hitting the President first.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0141.wav|Oswald could have shot the Governor as the car approached the Depository or as it was making the turn onto Elm Street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0143.wav|the President almost completely blocked Oswald's view of the Governor prior to the time the first shot struck the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0144.wav|Oswald would have had other and more favorable opportunities to strike at the Governor than on this occasion when, as a member of the President's party,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0145.wav|he had more protection than usual. It would appear, therefore, that to the extent Oswald's undesirable discharge affected his motivation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0146.wav|it was more in terms of a general hostility against the government and its representatives rather than a grudge against any particular person.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0147.wav|Interest in Marxism
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0148.wav|As indicated above, Oswald started to read Communist literature after he and his mother left New York and moved to New Orleans.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0150.wav|I'm a Marxist. I became interested about the age of fifteen. From an ideological viewpoint.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0152.wav|Oswald studied Marxism after he joined the Marines and his sympathies in that direction and for the Soviet Union appear to have been widely known,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0153.wav|at least in the unit to which he was assigned after his return from the Far East.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0154.wav|His interest in Russia led some of his associates to call him "comrade" or "Oswaldskovitch."
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0155.wav|He always wanted to play the red pieces in chess because, as he said in an apparently humorous context,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0157.wav|He studied the Russian language, read a Russian language newspaper and seemed interested in what was going on in the Soviet Union.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0162.wav|Thornley also testified about an incident which grew
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0163.wav|out of a combination of Oswald's known Marxist sympathies and George Orwell's book "nineteen eighty-four," one of Oswald's favorite books
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0164.wav|which Thornley read at Oswald's suggestion.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0165.wav|Shortly after Thornley finished reading that book the Marine unit to which both men were assigned was required to take part in a Saturday morning parade
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0167.wav|While waiting for the parade to start they talked briefly about "nineteen eighty-four"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0168.wav|even though Oswald seemed to be lost in his own thoughts. After a brief period of silence Oswald remarked on the stupidity of the parade
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0170.wav|Thornley testified, quote, At which time he looked at me like a betrayed Caesar and screamed, screamed definitely, "Not you, too, Thornley!"
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0171.wav|And I remember his voice cracked as he said this. He was definitely disturbed at what I had said and I didn't really think I had said that much.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0172.wav|I never said anything to him again and he never said anything to me again, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0174.wav|and had not intended any criticism of Oswald's political views which is the way in which, Thornley thought, Oswald took his remarks.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0175.wav|Lieutenant Donovan testified that Oswald thought that, quote, there were many grave injustices concerning the affairs in the international situation, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0176.wav|He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin America, particularly Cuba,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0100.wav|Even though he received more money and better living quarters than other Russians doing similar work,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0103.wav|Oswald apparently resented the exercise of authority over him and the better treatment afforded to Communist Party officials.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0119.wav|Under the entry for August to September of that year he wrote, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0120.wav|As my Russian improves I become increasingly conscious of just what sort of a society I live in.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0134.wav|The psychological effects of that change must have been highly unsettling. It should be remembered
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0136.wav|His attempt to renounce his citizenship had been an open expression of hostility against the United States and a profound rejection of his early life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0138.wav|His return to the United States publicly testified to the utter failure of what had been the most important act of his life.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0153.wav|This was a fairly coherent description of life in that country, basically centered around the radio and television factory in which he worked.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0156.wav|Oswald prefaced his manuscript with a short autobiographical sketch which reads in part as follows, quote,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0159.wav|entering the US Marine corp at seventeen, this streak of independence was strengthened by exotic journeys to Japan,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0197.wav|seemed to place him in a situation in which he could not live with satisfaction either in the United States or in the Soviet Union.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0198.wav|The discussion above has already set forth examples of his expression of hatred for the United States.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0199.wav|He also expressed hatred of the Soviet Union and of the Communist Party, U.S.A.,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0203.wav|not in the name of freedom or high ideals,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0204.wav|but in servile conformity to the wishes of the Soviet Union and in anticipation of Soviet Russia's complete domination of the American continent.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0221.wav|With either great ambivalence, or cold calculation he prepared completely different answers to the same questions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0223.wav|and to have stated in the second what he thought would be least harmful to him as he resumed life in the United States.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0224.wav|For example, in response to his questions about his decision to go to the Soviet Union, his first draft answered, quote,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0227.wav|His second answer was that he, quote, went as a citizen of the U.S. (as a tourist) residing in a foreign country which I have a perfect right to do.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0025.wav|He even threatened to tear up his wife's dresses and break all the baby things. According to De Mohrenschildt,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0034.wav|Contacts with De Mohrenschildt and his wife did continue and they saw the Oswalds occasionally until the spring of nineteen sixty-three.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0065.wav|Oswald experienced some difficulty finding employment. Perhaps this was partially because of his lack of any specific skill or training.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0067.wav|that his employment difficulties were caused by his telling prospective employers that he had last been employed in Minsk.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0094.wav|This was at least in part because of the close physical confines in which some of the work had to be done.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0095.wav|He did not seem to be able to make the accommodations necessary when people work under such conditions and as a result
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0096.wav|became involved in conflicts, some of which were fairly heated, with his fellow employees.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0098.wav|it began to appear that Oswald was having considerable difficulty doing accurate work and in getting along with the other employees.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0099.wav|It appears that his discharge was hastened by the fact that he brought a Russian language newspaper to work.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0100.wav|It is not possible to tell whether Oswald did this to provide an excuse for his eventual discharge,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0102.wav|It is possible that his immediate supervisor noticed the newspaper at that time because his attention had otherwise been drawn more directly to Oswald.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0199.wav|In retrospect his attempt to go to Cuba or return to the Soviet Union may well have been Oswald's last escape hatch,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0201.wav|Oswald's activities with regard to Cuba raise serious questions as to how much he might have been motivated in the assassination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0202.wav|by a desire to aid the Castro regime, which President Kennedy so outspokenly criticized.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0203.wav|For example, the Dallas Times Herald of November nineteen, nineteen sixty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0206.wav|The Castro regime severely attacked President Kennedy in connection with the Bay of Pigs affair, the Cuban missile crisis, the ban on travel to Cuba,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0218.wav|In this connection it should be noted that in speaking of the Worker, Oswald told Michael Paine, apparently in all seriousness, that, quote,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0220.wav|The general conflict of views between the United States and Cuba was, of course, reflected in other media to such an extent
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0222.wav|Oswald was asked during the New Orleans radio debate in which he engaged on August twenty-one, nineteen sixty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0223.wav|whether or not he agreed with Castro that President Kennedy was a, quote, ruffian and a thief, end quote. He replied that he, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0225.wav|It should also be noted, however, that one witness testified that shortly before the assassination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0226.wav|Oswald had expressed approval of President Kennedy's active role in the area of civil rights.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0229.wav|and had lost his desire to do so because of the bureaucracy and red tape which he had encountered.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0230.wav|His unhappy experience with the Cuban consul seems thus to have reduced his enthusiasm for the Castro regime and his desire to go to Cuba.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0231.wav|While some of Castro's more severe criticisms of President Kennedy might have led Oswald to believe that he would be well received in Cuba
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0232.wav|after he had assassinated the American President, it does not appear that he had any plans to go there.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0233.wav|Oswald was carrying only thirteen dollars, eighty-seven cents at the time of his arrest, although he had left, apparently by design,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0235.wav|If there was no conspiracy which would help him escape, the possibility of which has been considered in chapter six,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0236.wav|it is unlikely that a reasoning person would plan to attempt to travel from Dallas, Texas to Cuba

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0004.wav|It has been suggested that one of the motivating influences operating on Lee Oswald was the atmosphere in the city of Dallas,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0005.wav|especially an atmosphere of extreme opposition to President Kennedy that was present in some parts of the Dallas community
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0006.wav|and which received publicity there prior to the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0007.wav|Some of that feeling was expressed in the incident involving then vice-presidential candidate Johnson during the nineteen sixty campaign,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0063.wav|Oswald apparently wished to continue practicing his own Russian with her. Lieutenant Martello of the New Orleans police testified
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0065.wav|Marina Oswald's inability to speak English also made it more difficult for her to have an independent existence in this country.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0119.wav|which had led to the disclosure of his defection in New Orleans.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0121.wav|it does not appear that he ever lost his job because of its activities, although he may well not have been aware of that fact.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0122.wav|While Oswald's concern about the FBI had some basis in fact, in that FBI agents had interviewed him in the past and had renewed their interest
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0125.wav|For example, in his letter of November nine, nineteen sixty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0126.wav|to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, he asked about the entrance visas for which he and his wife had previously applied.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0127.wav|He absolved the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City of any blame for his difficulties there. He advised the Washington Embassy
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0128.wav|that the FBI was, quote, not now, end quote, interested in his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities, but noted that the FBI, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0133.wav|The claimed warning was one more of Oswald's fabrications.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0135.wav|but did not issue any such warning or suggest that Marina Oswald defect from the Soviet Union and remain in the United States under FBI protection,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0136.wav|as Oswald went on to say. In Oswald's imagination, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0140.wav|The arguments he used to justify his use of the alias suggest that Oswald may have come to think that the whole world was becoming involved
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0141.wav|in an increasingly complex conspiracy against him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0145.wav|Those arguments, however, were not persuasive to Marina Oswald,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0146.wav|to whom, quote, it was nothing terrible if people were to find out that he had been in Russia, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0148.wav|After all, when will all your foolishness come to an end? All of these comedies. First one thing and then another. And now this fictitious name, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0149.wav|She said, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0150.wav|On Monday, November eighteen, nineteen sixty-three, he called several times, but after I hung up on him and didn't want to talk to him he did not call again.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0155.wav|Question: Did you say anything to him then?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0157.wav|Answer: I was angry, of course. He was not angry -- he was upset. I was angry. He tried very hard to please me.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0158.wav|He spent quite a bit of time putting away diapers and played with the children on the street.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0159.wav|Question: How did you indicate to him that you were angry with him? Answer: By not talking to him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0162.wav|He tried to start a conversation with me several times, but I would not answer. And he said that he didn't want me to be angry at him because this upsets him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0165.wav|That if I want to he would rent an apartment in Dallas tomorrow -- that he didn't want me to remain with Ruth any longer, but wanted me to live with him in Dallas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0168.wav|Answer: I said it would be better if I remained with Ruth until the holidays, he would come, and we would all meet together.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0170.wav|it became too difficult to wash by hand.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0172.wav|Answer: He said he would buy me a washing machine.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0174.wav|Thank you. That it would be better if he bought something for himself -- that I would manage. End quote. That night Oswald went to bed before his wife retired.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0175.wav|She did not speak to him when she joined him there, although she thought that he was still awake.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0176.wav|The next morning he left for work before anyone else arose.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0181.wav|No one will ever know what passed through Oswald's mind during the week before November twenty-two, nineteen sixty-three.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0182.wav|Instead of returning to Irving on November fifteen for his customary weekend visit, he remained in Dallas at his wife's suggestion because of the birthday party.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0183.wav|He had argued with her over the use of an alias and had not called her after that argument, although he usually telephoned once or twice a day.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0184.wav|Then on Thursday morning, November twenty-one,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0189.wav|it should be noted that mention of the Trade Mart as the expected site of the Presidential luncheon
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0191.wav|The next day that paper announced the final approval of the Trade Mart as the luncheon site and stated that the motorcade, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0193.wav|en route from Dallas Love Field, end quote, on its way to the Trade Mart on Stemmons Freeway.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0194.wav|Anyone who was familiar with that area of Dallas would have known that the motorcade would probably pass the Texas School Book Depository to get from Main Street
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0195.wav|onto the Stemmons Freeway.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0196.wav|That fact was made precisely clear in subsequent news stories on November nineteen, twenty, and twenty-two.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0198.wav|that the Presidential motorcade would pass in front of his place of work.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0199.wav|Whether he thought about assassinating the President over the weekend can never be known, but it is reasonably certain
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0200.wav|that over the weekend he did think about his wife's request that he not come to Irving, which was prompted by the birthday party being held at the Paine home.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0201.wav|Oswald had a highly exaggerated sense of his own importance, but he had failed at almost everything he had ever tried to do.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0202.wav|He had great difficulty in establishing meaningful relations with other people. Except for his family he was completely alone.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0204.wav|he had never found anything to which he felt he could really belong.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0206.wav|it must have appeared to him that he was unable to command even the attention of his family.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0212.wav|this time concerning his use of an alias.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0214.wav|ended when Marina Oswald hung up and refused to talk to him. Although he may long before have decided on the course he was to follow
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0215.wav|and may have told his wife the things he did on the evening of November twenty-one,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0221.wav|It is unlikely that the motivation was that simple.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0222.wav|The feelings of hostility and aggression which seem to have played such an important, part in Oswald's life
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0223.wav|were part of his character long before he met his wife
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0226.wav|The fact that he took so little money with him when he left Irving in the morning indicates that he did not expect to get very far from Dallas on his own
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0227.wav|and suggests the possibility, as did his note to his wife just prior to the attempt on General Walker, that he did not expect to escape at all.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0228.wav|On the other hand, he could have traveled some distance with the money he did have and he did return to his room where he obtained his revolver.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0229.wav|He then killed Patrolman Tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted arrest
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0230.wav|when he was finally apprehended in the Texas Theatre. Although it is not fully corroborated by others who were present,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0231.wav|two officers have testified that at the time of his arrest Oswald said something to the effect that, quote, it's all over now, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0232.wav|Oswald was overbearing and arrogant throughout much of the time between his arrest and his own death.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0234.wav|While he did become enraged at at least one point in his interrogation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0237.wav|His denials under questioning, which have no probative value in view of the many readily demonstrable lies he told at that time
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0240.wav|Many factors were undoubtedly involved in Oswald's motivation for the assassination, and the Commission does not believe
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0242.wav|It is apparent, however, that Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0243.wav|He does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful relationships with other people. He was perpetually discontented with the world around him.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0244.wav|Long before the assassination he expressed his hatred for American society and acted in protest against it.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0247.wav|His commitment to Marxism and communism appears to have been another important factor in his motivation.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0005.wav|Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0027.wav|However, all information considered by the Commission which pertains to the protective function as it was carried out in Dallas has been published as part of this report.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0028.wav|The protection of the President of the United States is an immensely difficult and complex task.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0031.wav|The protective task is further complicated by the reluctance of Presidents to take security precautions which might interfere with the performance of their duties,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0035.wav|After reviewing this aspect of the matter this chapter will set forth the Commission's conclusions
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0038.wav|The President is Head of State, Chief Executive, Commander in Chief, and leader of a political party.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0039.wav|As the ceremonial head of the Government the President must discharge a wide range of public duties, not only in Washington but throughout the land.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0040.wav|In this role he appears to the American people, in the words of William Howard Taft, as, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0046.wav|In all of these roles the President must go to the people.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0047.wav|Exposure of the President to public view through travel among the people of this country is a great and historic tradition of American life.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0049.wav|More often than not, Presidential journeys have served more than one purpose at the same time: ceremonial,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0050.wav|administrative, political.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0052.wav|To promote nationwide acceptance of his administration Washington made grand tours that served also to excite interest in the Presidency.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0053.wav|In recent years, Presidential journeys have been frequent and extensive,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0056.wav|in seventeen eighty-nine in less time than it took George Washington to travel from New York to Mount Vernon
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0058.wav|During his Presidency, Franklin D. Roosevelt made almost four hundred journeys and traveled more than three hundred fifty thousand miles.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0059.wav|Since nineteen forty-five, Roosevelt's successors have ranged the world,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0060.wav|and their foreign journeys have come to be accepted as normal rather than extraordinary.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0061.wav|John F. Kennedy's journey to Texas in November nineteen sixty-three was in this tradition.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0062.wav|His friend and Special Assistant Kenneth O'Donnell, who accompanied him on his last visit to Dallas,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0066.wav|And he felt that leaving Washington for the President of the United States was a most necessary -- not only for the people, but for the President himself,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0069.wav|I think he felt very strongly that the President ought to get out of Washington, and go meet the people on a regular basis. End quote.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0169.wav|Hosty took the necessary steps to have the Dallas office of the FBI, rather than the New Orleans office, reestablished as the office with principal responsibility.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0170.wav|On November five, Hosty was traveling near Mrs. Paine's home and took the occasion to stop by to ask whether she had any further information.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0171.wav|Mrs. Paine had nothing to add to what she had already told him, except that during a visit that past weekend,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0173.wav|and that she found this and similar statements illogical and somewhat amusing. On this occasion Hosty was at the Paine residence for only a few minutes.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0175.wav|or telephone number in Dallas. Mrs. Paine testified that she learned Oswald's telephone number at the Beckley Street roominghouse in the middle of October
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0178.wav|because she thought the FBI was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where Oswald was living.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0179.wav|Hosty did nothing further in connection with the Oswald case until after the assassination. On November one, nineteen sixty-three,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0180.wav|he had received a copy of the report of the New Orleans office which contained Agent Quigley's memorandum of the interview in the New Orleans jail on August ten,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0181.wav|and realized immediately that Oswald had given false biographic information. Hosty knew that he would eventually have to investigate this, and, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0183.wav|When asked what his next step would have been, Hosty replied, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0187.wav|It was then my plan to interview Marina Oswald in detail concerning both herself and her husband's background. Question:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0188.wav|Had you planned any steps beyond that point?
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0190.wav|Question: Did you take any action on this case between November five and November twenty-two? Answer: No, sir.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0191.wav|The official Bureau files confirm Hosty's statement that from November five until the assassination, no active investigation was conducted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0193.wav|and so advised the Dallas office in the ordinary course of business.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0196.wav|The Commission has considered carefully the question whether the FBI,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0211.wav|would have added up to pointing out a pretty bad individual, and I think that, together, had we known that he had a vantage point

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0230.wav|Hosty testified that he would not have cited him to the Secret Service as a potential threat to the President. Hosty interpreted his instructions as requiring, quote,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0011.wav|Neither believed that the Bureau investigation of him up to November twenty-two revealed any information which would have justified referral to the Secret Service.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0013.wav|he indicated that he had learned his lesson,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0020.wav|The interview with him in jail is not significant from the standpoint of whether he had a propensity for violence.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0023.wav|and he had told us during one of the interviews that he would probably take his wife back to Soviet Russia some time in the future.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0024.wav|He had come back to Dallas. Hosty had established that he had a job, he was working,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0025.wav|and had told Mrs. Paine that when he got the money he was going to take an apartment, when the baby was old enough, he was going to take an apartment, and the family would live together.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0029.wav|As reflected in this testimony,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0030.wav|the officials of the FBI believed that there was no data in its files which gave warning that Oswald was a source of danger to President Kennedy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0034.wav|no law enforcement agency had any information to connect Oswald with the attempted shooting of General Walker.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0037.wav|overlooking the motorcade route as a source of danger to the President and did not inform the Secret Service of his employment in the Depository Building.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0048.wav|All this does seem to amount to enough to have induced an alert agency, such as the FBI,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0049.wav|possessed of this information to list Oswald as a potential threat to the safety of the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0050.wav|This conclusion may be tinged with hindsight, but
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0051.wav|it stated primarily to direct the thought of those responsible for the future safety of our Presidents to the need for a more imaginative
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0054.wav|which specifically required the referral of such a case as Oswald's to the Secret Service,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0063.wav|The formal FBI instructions to its agents outlining the information to be referred to the Secret Service were too narrow at the time of the assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0064.wav|While the Secret Service bears the principal responsibility for this failure,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0065.wav|the FBI instructions did not reflect fully the Secret Service's need for information regarding potential threats.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0067.wav|It is clear from Hosty's testimony that this was construed, at least by him,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0072.wav|the Commission does not believe that the liaison between the FBI and the Secret Service prior to the assassination was as effective as it should have been.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0074.wav|To insure adequate and effective liaison arrangements,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0084.wav|some limited information was made available to the Secret Service. But there was no fully adequate liaison between the two agencies. Indeed,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0087.wav|The President's trip to Dallas called into play many standard operating procedures of the Secret Service in addition to its preventive intelligence operations.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0090.wav|certain shortcomings and lapses from the high standards which the Commission believes should prevail in the field of Presidential protection are evident.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0096.wav|In the case of Dallas, because President Kennedy had scheduled visits to five Texas cities
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0097.wav|and had also scheduled visits to other parts of the country immediately before the Texas trip,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0099.wav|Agent Lawson did the advance work alone from November thirteen to November eighteen, when he was joined by Agent David B. Grant,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0101.wav|The Commission concludes that the most significant advance arrangements for the President's trip were soundly planned.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0102.wav|In particular, the Commission believes that the motorcade route selected by Agent Lawson, upon the advice of Agent in Charge Sorrels
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0103.wav|and with the concurrence of the Dallas police, was entirely appropriate, in view of the known desires of the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0104.wav|There were far safer routes via freeways directly to the Trade Mart,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0109.wav|by these Secret Service agents with the cooperation of the Dallas police and other local law enforcement agents, were carefully executed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0110.wav|Since the President was to be at the Trade Mart longer than at any other location in Dallas and in view of the security hazards presented by the building,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0112.wav|The Commission also regards the security arrangements worked out by Lawson and Sorrels at Love Field as entirely adequate.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0113.wav|The Commission believes, however,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0115.wav|to determine what matters require attention in making advance preparations and to decide what action to take.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0121.wav|The interim report must be in the hands of the agent supervising the protective group traveling with the President
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0123.wav|Agent Lawson's interim report was received by Agent Kellerman on November twenty, the day before departure on the Texas trip.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0127.wav|as those followed in nineteen thirty-six during a trip to Dallas by President Roosevelt,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0137.wav|there have been references to the numerous discussions between Secret Service representatives and the Dallas Police Department.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0138.wav|The wholehearted support of these local authorities was indispensable to the Service in carrying out its duties.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0142.wav|Despite this dependence on local authorities, which would be substantially the same on a visit by the President to any large city,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0144.wav|It had no prepared checklist of matters to be covered with local police on such visits to metropolitan areas
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0145.wav|and no written description of the role the local police were expected to perform.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0146.wav|Discussions with the Dallas authorities and requests made of them were entirely informal.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0153.wav|while on the overpass overlooking the assassination scene railroad and yard terminal workmen were permitted to remain under police supervision,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0154.wav|as discussed in chapter three.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0169.wav|In Dallas the route selected necessarily involved passing through the principal downtown section between tall buildings.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0171.wav|it was not practical to select a route where the President could not be seen from roofs or windows of buildings.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0028.wav|The Secret Service has therefore suggested this practice only on extraordinary occasions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0029.wav|Without attempting to prescribe or recommend specific measures which should be employed for the future protection of Presidents,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0079.wav|Many changes have already been made and others are contemplated, some of them in response to the Commission's questions and informal suggestions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0080.wav|Assassination a Federal Crime
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0083.wav|it has long been a Federal crime to conspire to injure any Federal officer, on account of, or while he is engaged in, the lawful discharge of the duties of his office.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0088.wav|as is advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by the assassination of any of its officers.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0091.wav|Equally anomalous are statutory provisions which specifically authorize the Secret Service to protect the President,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0095.wav|for all offenses within its jurisdiction, as are FBI agents and Federal marshals.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0098.wav|In nineteen oh two bills passed both Houses of Congress but failed of enactment when the Senate refused to accept the conference report.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0099.wav|A number of bills were introduced immediately following the assassination of President Kennedy.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0100.wav|The Commission recommends to the Congress that it adopt legislation which would:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0103.wav|whether or not the act is committed while the victim is in the performance of his official duties or on account of such performance.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0106.wav|Restricting the coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary controversy over the inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are in the order of succession
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0107.wav|or who hold important governmental posts.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0108.wav|In addition, the restriction would probably eliminate a need for the requirement which has been urged as necessary for the exercise of Federal power,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0110.wav|The governmental consequences of assassination of one of the specified officials give the United States ample power to act for its own protection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0111.wav|The activities of the victim at the time an assassination occurs and the motive for the assassination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0113.wav|This point was ably made in the nineteen oh two debate by Senator George F. Hoar, the sponsor of the Senate bill, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0115.wav|of the person who is actually in the exercise of the executive power, or
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0119.wav|would be conducted by Federal law enforcement officials, in particular, the FBI with the assistance of the Secret Service.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0120.wav|At present, Federal agencies participate only upon the sufferance of the local authorities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0121.wav|While the police work of the Dallas authorities in the early identification and apprehension of Oswald was both efficient and prompt,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0124.wav|In addition, the proposed legislation will insure
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0125.wav|that any suspects who are arrested will be Federal prisoners, subject to Federal protection from vigilante justice and other threats.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0129.wav|while the CIA has the primary responsibility for collecting intelligence overseas to supplement information acquired by the Department of State.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0132.wav|The Commission believes that it is necessary to improve the cooperation among these agencies
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0133.wav|and to emphasize that the task of Presidential protection is one of broad national concern.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0134.wav|The Commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning to a Cabinet-level committee or the National Security Council
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0137.wav|and the other Federal agencies that assist in safeguarding the President. The Committee should include the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0139.wav|and the Attorney General at any meetings which are concerned with Presidential protection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0141.wav|The foremost assignment of the Committee would be to insure that the maximum resources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the job of protecting the President,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0144.wav|The Committee would be able to provide guidance in defining the general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0149.wav|that it has been unable, as a practical matter, to exercise sufficient influence over the security precautions which surround Presidential activities.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0152.wav|The assignment of the responsibility of protecting the President to an agency of the Department of the Treasury was largely an historical accident.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0153.wav|The Secret Service was organized as a division of the Department of the Treasury in eighteen sixty-five, to deal with counterfeiting.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0154.wav|In eighteen ninety-four,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0156.wav|Secret Service men accompanied the President and his family to their vacation home in Massachusetts
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0159.wav|the Secret Service, then the only Federal investigative agency, assumed full-time responsibility for the safety of the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0160.wav|Since that time, the Secret Service has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of the President
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0161.wav|and also for the preventive investigation of potential threats against the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0162.wav|Although the Secret Service has had the primary responsibility for the protection of the President,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0163.wav|the FBI, which was established within the Department of Justice in nineteen oh eight, has had in recent years an increasingly important role to play.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0164.wav|In the appropriations of the FBI there has recurred annually an item for the, quote, protection of the person of the President of the United States, end quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0165.wav|which first appeared in the appropriation of the Department of Justice in nineteen ten under the heading, quote, Miscellaneous Objects, end quote.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0166.wav|Although the FBI is not charged with the physical protection of the President, it does have an assignment, as do other Government agencies,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0167.wav|in the field of preventive investigation in regard to the President's security.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0169.wav|the procedures which its agents are to follow in connection with information received, quote,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0170.wav|indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President, end quote, or other protected persons.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0171.wav|With two Federal agencies operating in the same general field of preventive investigation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0172.wav|questions inevitably arise as to the scope of each agency's authority and responsibility.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0173.wav|As the testimony of J. Edgar Hoover and other Bureau officials revealed, the FBI did not believe that its directive required the Bureau
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0175.wav|before the President reached Dallas.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0180.wav|The Commission has the impression
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0181.wav|that too much emphasis is placed by both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not enough on dangers from other sources.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0183.wav|regarding such threats and that its Protective Research Section is not adequately staffed or equipped
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0184.wav|to conduct the wider investigative work that is required today for the security of the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0185.wav|During the period the Commission was giving thought to this situation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0186.wav|the Commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0191.wav|is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the United States.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0192.wav|It was also suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the Secret Service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the problem.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0193.wav|Consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one hand, that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the President
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0194.wav|should be transferred to the FBI,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0195.wav|leaving with the Secret Service only the responsibility for the physical protection of the President, that is, the guarding function alone.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0200.wav|It is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the President
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0203.wav|So circumscribed, it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0204.wav|While in accordance with its mandate
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0205.wav|this Commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various Federal agencies concerned with the tragic trip of President Kennedy to Dallas
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0207.wav|that it was not within the Commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long-range organization of the President's protection,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0208.wav|except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination of the President's assassination can be drawn.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0209.wav|The Commission was not asked to apply itself as did the Hoover Commission in nineteen forty-nine,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0210.wav|for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the President's protection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0211.wav|It would have been necessary for the Commission to take considerable testimony, much of it extraneous to the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0212.wav|to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0215.wav|the protection of the President is in a real sense a Government-wide responsibility which must necessarily assumed by the Department of State,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0217.wav|Moreover, a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the intimate association now established
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0218.wav|between the Secret Service and the President and his family is contemplated.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0221.wav|perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the Cabinet-level committee recommended above or the National Security Council.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0222.wav|Pending any such determination, however, this Commission is convinced of the necessity of better coordination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0224.wav|and services related to the security of the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0225.wav|The Commission feels the Secret Service and the FBI, as well as the State Department and the CIA when the President travels abroad,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0226.wav|could improve their existing capacities and procedures so as to lessen the chances of assassination.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0229.wav|while assuming no radical relocation of responsibilities,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0230.wav|can and should be recommended by this Commission in the interest of the more efficient protection of the President.

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0057.wav|specifying criteria for information to be furnished to the Secret Service in addition to that covered by the former standard,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0081.wav|The new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0086.wav|Under these criteria, whether the case should be referred to the Secret Service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability,

datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0137.wav|FBI, and the Secret Service.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0138.wav|In addition, the Department of the Treasury has requested five additional agents for its Protective Research Section
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0139.wav|to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and intelligence agencies. On the basis of the Department's review during the past several months,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0142.wav|directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0145.wav|and the Commission recommends that these and the other measures suggested by the Commission be pursued vigorously by Secret Service.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0147.wav|Unless the Secret Service is able to deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0149.wav|PRS must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0152.wav|The Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury now recognize this critical need.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0155.wav|Also the Department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study;
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0157.wav|On the basis of such a feasibility study,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0160.wav|The Commission further recommends that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0162.wav|In planning its data processing techniques,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0163.wav|the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. Note:
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0164.wav|In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret Service,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0171.wav|but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0172.wav|The Commission, therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0173.wav|that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated, without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0174.wav|Protective Research participation in advance arrangements.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0175.wav|Since the assassination, Secret Service procedures have been changed to require that a member of PRS accompany each advance survey team
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0176.wav|to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0177.wav|This PRS agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal local liaison committee
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0178.wav|to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0179.wav|Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0182.wav|Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0183.wav|Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential visit
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0184.wav|has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0188.wav|each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. The Secret Service has expressed concern
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0190.wav|However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0191.wav|More importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0192.wav|can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0193.wav|Such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0194.wav|and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0196.wav|Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0201.wav|in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0205.wav|Testimony and other evidence before the Commission
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0207.wav|Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0209.wav|The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0210.wav|the caseload of each FBI agent averaged twenty to twenty-five, and he felt that this was high.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0211.wav|Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0212.wav|While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0214.wav|Although the Commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0217.wav|the Secret Service sought funds for twenty-five new positions, primarily in field offices. This increase has been approved by the Congress.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0219.wav|However, the nineteen sixty-four to sixty-five budget request was submitted in November nineteen sixty-three
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0220.wav|and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0222.wav|would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0227.wav|in case of unexpected need; and twenty-five additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0228.wav|The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0229.wav|as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0232.wav|to assist in its protection functions.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0235.wav|It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0238.wav|which represents a departure from its prior practice.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0239.wav|From February eleven through June thirty, nineteen sixty-four,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0242.wav|even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0245.wav|In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a size
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0249.wav|It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0255.wav|This no longer appears to be the case.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0256.wav|Protecting the President is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our Government.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0261.wav|from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the President's Office of Science and Technology.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0267.wav|between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0272.wav|and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0273.wav|The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedy's assassination
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0275.wav|materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0276.wav|As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,
datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0278.wav|the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties.
